# Aviation Accidents Visualization Project

----

Air travel stands as an undeniable revolution in the transportation sector, delivering a multitude of invaluable advantages: unprecedented speed, unparalleled global connectivity, and a continuous drive for innovation. Nevertheless, the aviation industry encounters its fair share of challenges, especially concerning the issue of safety. In this project, we delve into the intricate tapestry of aviation safety, exploring how fatalities from accidents vary among different countries, aircraft types, and operators in a comprehensive analysis of over 50 years of aviation accident data (1970-2022). 

Questions we considered:
* Where are aviation accidents likely to occur?
* In recent years, are there certain airlines that have more crashes than others?
* Are there possible outside factors affecting these trends?

To find the answers to our questions, we obtained the requisite information by means of a customized Extract-Transform-Load process. The procurement of aviation accident information began with web scraping sources on the Internet.  Subsequently, an initial review of the information showed important details mixed together with irrelenant ones in various and inconsistent forms.  To compensate for this obstacle, we implemented algorithms to parse text for important specifics, verify or augment information using APIs and other sources, and standardize the data.  After placing the cleaned information in an SQLite database, a Flask API provides it to front-end applications in an efficent and effective manner. To accomplish our goal of interactive visualization, we employed certain technologies -- D3, JSON, JS, Plotly, Bootstrap, among others -- and aimed to create an informative representation of historical aviation accident data, which could allow stakeholders to uncover patterns, trends, and insight.

To best convey our findings, we summarized them in a series of visual aids. First, our analysis revealed a downward trend in fatalities from aviation accidents over the last fifty years. 

<img width="617" alt="image" src="https://github.com/njgeorge000158/Aviation-Accidents-Visualization-Project/assets/137228821/177588e2-cf44-4a1d-8b06-e48e3e4234dc">

This downward trend also manifested itself in a lower average casualty rate per flight and lower and narrower casualty rate distributions.

Overall and most recently, accidents occur when the aircraft is en route or approaching its destination.

In the last fifty years, Aeroflot has been the airline with the highest fatalities although these accidents primarily happened during the Soviet era in the 1970s and 1980s. In the last few years, China Eastern Airlines has had a troublingly high number of fatalities in a time of safer aircraft and practices.

The aircraft most prone to fatalities from aviation accidents is the Tupolev TU-154, a Soviet era aircraft, followed by the Lockheed L-1011 and Boeing 727.  In the last twenty years or so the Boeing 737 has been the leader in this infamous category.

In any period, domestic scheduled passenger flights are most likely to have fatalities from aviation accidents followed by international scheduled passenger flights.

In the last few years, certain Chinese departure and destination airports have had the largest proportion of accidents.

Also, Russia has consistently been the a location for high numbers of fatalities even though China has lately taken on that mantle.

Ultimately, we could not accurately predict the locations of aircraft accidents only the likelihood based on past events and those parameters change from decade to decade, but we did observe some trends.  During the last few years, China Eastern Airlines has experienced the highest number fatalities. Currently, possible outside factors for these aviation fatalities include terrorism, political upheaval, and cultural practices. In any case, the next China Eastern Airlines' domestic passenger flight from Kunming Changshui International Airport to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport on a Boeing 737 should likely be avoided! This project is a positive first step toward understanding aviation accidents, and, in the future, these fatalities should be compared with total flight data to render percentages as the metric for a clearer picture of the situation.
