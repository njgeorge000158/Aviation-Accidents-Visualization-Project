0,ACC2278,"A South African Air Force (SAAF) Lockheed C-130BZ Hercules of SAAF 28 sqn crash landed at Goma International Airport (GOM/FZNA). A fire erupted after the left hand wing, outboard of the no.1 engine, broke. The fire was quickly contained.There were no fatalities. The military transport plane was carrying 8 crew members and 59 South African troops."
1,ACC2279,"A Metro III operated by Perimeter Aviation as flight 415, departed Thompson (CYTH) for Shamattawa (CZTM), Canada, with 12 passengers and 2 crew members.During the landing rollout on runway 19 at approximately 60 knots, aircraft directional control was lost and the aircraft encountered a runway excursion to the right and collided with a snow berm at a groundspeed of less than 20 knots. The right hand propeller made contact with a snow berm and shattered upon impact. There were no injuries. A NOTAM was issued closing the airport until the aircraft was removed from the runway.The aircraft sustained damage to the left engine nacelle, nose gear doors, and right propeller. The reported runway condition at the time of occurrence was 100% compacted snow. Data retrieved from the aircraft's navigation system indicated the winds were 255 degrees at 18 knots on short final prior to touchdown."
2,ACC2280,"Air Inuit flight 820, a DHC-8-314, suffered a tail strike on landing at Schefferville Airport, Canada. The aircraft had departed Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport (CYUL) at 07:06 hours local time on a multi-stop flight to Salluit. The accident occurred on the second leg, from Montréal to Schefferville."
3,ACC2281,"A Cessna S550 Citation S/II of the South African Civil Aviation Authority crashed into the Outeniqua mountains, near the town of Friemersheim. The three occupants were killed and the aircraft was destroyed.The Citation departed Port Elizabeth Airport (FAPE) on a positioning flight to George Airport (FAGG). On approach to FAGG, the flying crew requested to carry out a calibration flight for the very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon at FAGG. Due to inclement weather conditions at the time, they were not cleared to conduct VOR calibration. As a result, they decided to land and refuel the aircraft before commencing with the calibration of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) on runway 11 at FAGG. The flying crew requested take-off from runway 11 and an early right turn to intercept radial 250°, 17 nautical miles (nm) DME arc to radial 330° at 3000 feet (ft) climbing to 4000ft. The air traffic control (ATC) granted their request.Radar data indicated that at 10:42, the aircraft took off from runway 11 and, once airborne, made a right-hand turn to intercept radial 250° using the George VOR (GRV VOR). The aircraft climbed to 3000ft. Once the aircraft reached 17nm on the DME from the GRV VOR (DME is co-located with the VOR), it commenced with a right-hand turn to intercept radial 330° while maintaining 17nm DME arc.At 10:46, the ATC at FAGG advised the flying crew that they were now exiting controlled airspace and were advised to broadcast on the special rules frequency. The crew acknowledged the advisory to change frequency and there was no further communication. The aircraft was still being monitored by ATC using secondary surveillance radar.At 10:50, radar data showed the aircraft crossing radial 310° and entered a climb from 3000ft, reaching 3900ft. As the aircraft levelled off at 3900ft, a rapid descent occurred, and the aircraft lost 1500ft in approximately 9 seconds. Three seconds prior to impact, the aircraft nose pitched up before impacting a ridge at 2192ft."
4,ACC2282,"A Lockheed C-130 Hercules firefighting aircraft impacted terrain and burst into flames near Cooma, north-east of the Snowy Mountains in Australia. All three crew members died in the accident.The aircraft, contracted to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, departed Richmond RAAF Base, Australia at 12:05 local time. The crew had been tasked with a fire retardant drop over the Adaminaby Complex bush fire.After approaching the Adaminaby complex fire, the drop was unable to be completed and the aircraft was diverted to a secondary tasking, to drop retardant on the Good Good fire. Witnesses reported seeing the aircraft complete a number of circuits, prior to completing the retardant drop. The drop was conducted on a heading of about 190°, at about 200 ft above ground level, with a drop time of approximately 2 seconds. The crew released about 1,200 US gallons (4,500 L) of fire retardant during the drop.Witness videos taken of the aircraft leading up to the accident showed a number of passes conducted at varying heights prior to the retardant drop. Following the retardant drop, the aircraft was observed to bank left, before becoming obscured by smoke after about 5 seconds. A further 15 seconds after this, the aircraft was seen flying at a very low height above the ground, in a left wing down attitude. Shortly after, at about 13:16, the aircraft collided with terrain and a post-impact fuel-fed fire ensued. The three crew were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed."
5,ACC2283,"A Bombardier E-11A operated by the U.S. Air Force crashed in the Deh Yak district in Afghanistan, killing both pilots.The aircraft, part of 430th EECS wing, was outfitted with a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) and operated as a communications-relay platform out of Kandahar Airport, Afghanistan. At the time of the accident the aircraft operated on a combat sortie as well as a Mission Qualification Training for the first officer.Takeoff occurred at 11:05 local time. The flight proceeded to the assigned orbit using standard departure/climb procedures. The crew assumed a circular orbit just west of Kabul at 42,000 feet altitude at about 11:36. At 12:50, the crew requested and was cleared by ATC to climb from 42,000 feet altitude to 43,000 feet altitude. The engine revolutions per minute (RPMs) advanced and the crew initiated the climb with the autopilot, gaining about 300 feet. At 12:50:52, a fan blade broke free and separated from the N1 first-stage turbofan of the left engine, causing major damage and resulting in the immediate shutdown of that engine by the Electronic Engine Controller (EEC), a subsystem of the Full Authority Digital Engine Controller (FADEC). This was accompanied by a bang. Simultaneous with the bang, the CVR recording stopped. Within one to two seconds after the initial event, the autothrottles disengaged automatically. The autopilot was engaged and it remained engaged. Bank angles remained essentially constant, consistent with a circular orbit, and the aircraft descended from an altitude of 42,300 feet to 41,000 feet.Ten seconds after the catastrophic left engine failure, the crew retarded both throttles to just less than halfway (14 degrees; total throttle range is from 0  40 degrees) for one second, then slightly advancing the left throttle separately (26 degrees) for one second, then retarding it to align with the right throttle (both at 16 degrees) for one second, and finally splitting the throttles to advance the left throttle (to 31 degrees) while retarding the right to idle (0 degrees).Nine seconds after moving the right throttle to idle, the crew placed the right engine run switch to off, shutting down the right engine. Finally, at 12:51:19, the left throttle was advanced to full power (40 degrees), briefly cycled then brought to idle. At 12:51:23, both throttles were advanced from idle to full power.It is likely the crews first actions, including the shutdown, were hastened by a sense of urgency due to aircraft vibrations and other auditory/sensory cues, reinforced by the startle response.The crew announced to Kabul ATC that they had lost both engines and that they intended to proceed to Kandahar, which was well outside the E-11A glide capabilities.This intent suggests that the crew was confident of airstarting one or both engines.While the crew would have waited, in accordance with the checklist, to 30,000 feet to attempt an airstart, an airstart of the right engine should have been successful, whether accomplished with windmilling airspeed or with the assistance of the APU. However, airstarts of the left engine would have failed due to the original damage. There is no DFDR data to definitively confirm whether an engine airstart attempt was made.At 13:03:30, the crew announced to ATC that they were going to land at FOB Sharana. The aircraft continued to glide without engine power and was not able to reach Sharana.At approximately 13:09, the aircraft impacted the ground approximately 21 NM (39 km) short of Sharana, on a heading of roughly 140 degrees, consistent with a direct flight path towards Sharana. The terrain was unpopulated, largely flat, and covered in snow. The wings show the slats out and the flaps appear to be extended, suggesting that the aircraft had been configured for, and presumably slowed for, landing. It is likely that the crew attempted to make a forced landing.While the terrain was largely flat, the aircraft impacted berms and ditches, roughly estimated between 3-6 feet high. Weather at Sharana was reported to have 1000 foot ceilings, and pilot testimony confirms approximately 1000 foot ceilings in the vicinity of the accident site. Accordingly, the crew may have had less than a minute to maneuver after exiting the clouds and seeing the terrain. It appears that while the aircraft touched down, it impacted a smaller berm almost immediately, then more completely impacted the ground and skidded to a halt in approximately 340 meters. During this time the wings were ripped from the aircraft, and subsequently much of the cockpit and cabin were destroyed by fire."
6,ACC2284,"WestJet Encore flight 3107, a DHC-8-400, suffered a nose landing gear collapse on landing at Terrace Airport, Canada. It was snowing at the time of the accident. During the landing roll on runway 33, the aircraft departed the cleared area of the runway to the left, contacted a windrow, travelled partially off the runway surface, returned to the runway and stopped. The damage to the aircraft included the nose wheel collapsing and damage to the right propeller blades.The aircraft was ferried to Kelowna on May 27 and resumed service after final repairs on June 10, 2020."
7,ACC2285,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan airplane, N454SF, sustained substantial damage after overrunning the end of the runway during takeoff, at the Hooper Bay Airport (HPB), Alaska, USA. Of the 8 occupants onboard, the commercial pilot and six adult passengers, along with one infant passenger, were not injured. Day instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight plan was filed. The flight originated from HPB, about 15:58, and was destined for Bethel, Alaska (BET).According to the captain, the weather conditions the day of the accident consisted of snow, low visibility, and flat light. The original flight departure time had been delayed about 3 hours due to weather. The scheduled route of flight was from Bethel (BET), to Scammon Bay (SCM), to HPB, to Chevak (VAK), returning to BET with various passengers and cargo pick-ups and drop-offs along the route. Prior to departure from BET he received runway reports from his dispatcher that all destination airport runways were ready. He also obtained weather at all three destinations. He then did a risk analysis and gathered more weather before deeming the flight conditions good to dispatch the flight.While enroute to HPB he gathered weather for VAK and determined that the VAK portion of the flight would be canceled due to deteriorating weather. Once in HPB he landed without incident on the snow covered runway. He then called Grant dispatch in BET and informed that he would take all the passengers going to BET since he had canceled his flight to VAK; he loaded 7 passengers total and their bags. During the time on the ground, while waiting for passengers, a twin-engine King Air airplane landed and departed the runway with no incident.The pilot then back taxied for a runway 13 departure at HPB. He stated that flat light conditions prevailed, and it was difficult to see down the runway or have any depth perception. He initiated the takeoff with 20 degrees of flap selected and noticed no issues during the initial takeoff roll. He then noticed the airspeed was not increasing fast enough, witnessed the end of the runway approaching, and decided he could not abort the takeoff in time. Committed to the takeoff the airplane became airborne and the stall warning horn activated as the airplane cleared the departure end of the runway. The pilot attempted to get the airplane into ground effect, but the airplane settled, and the main landing gear encountered the snow covered terrain. Subsequently, the airplane's speed decreased, the nose wheel descended and encountered the snow, and the airplane came to rest upright about 150 ft from the end of the runway. All crew and passengers evacuated the airplane, and nobody was injured.The pilot added that the snow on the runway during departure was about 3-5 inches of wet heavy snow."
8,ACC2286,"A Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft, registered P2-MAI, owned and operated by Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) PNG Limited, experienced a loss of control during the landing roll at Miyanmin Airstrip, while conducting a non-scheduled flight, from Telefomin, PNG.There were 11 persons on board the aircraft; 2 pilots and 9 passengers. The pilot flying the aircraft was undergoing route and airstrip training. He was occupying the left seat and was Pilot Under Instruction (PUI). The pilot in the right seat was the instructor pilot for MAF conducting route and airstrip training for the new pilot.The pilot crossed overhead of the airstrip for an inspection of the surface and wind conditions. The crew did not observe any standing water or any wet areas on the strip. They also reported that the windsock indicated calm winds and the strip was clear.The aircraft joined mid-downwind less than half a nautical mile from the airstrip and tracked North West, descending from 1200 ft to 1000 ft before turning onto base. The aircraft began descending as it turned to line up on the final approach profile. There was a tailwind component of 5-12 kt on base and final. The aircraft overshot the turn onto final approach, 1.8 nm from the threshold at 900 ft. The pilot established the aircraft on the approach profile 1 nm from the threshold and at about 500 ft.The instructor stated that during final approach, the aircraft had descended below the normal approach profile causing him to instruct the pilot to adjust power and aim point to get back onto the correct profile.The pilot commenced the flare just under 20 ft AGL, 78 kt (85 kt ground speed).The aircraft touched down with an airspeed of 77 kt (82 kt ground speed) 36 m past the runway 11 threshold. The pilot stated that a few seconds after touchdown, he applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left. According to tyre track approximations, the aircraft appeared to have deviated about 220 m up-strip from threshold. The pilot stated that he applied full right rudder in an attempt to turn the aircraft back towards the center of the strip. The aircraft turned back to the right and rolled parallel to the centerline for another 100 m before it swerved left again, diverging at a 30° angle from the centerline. It rolled for 60 m as it bogged into the soft ground. The propeller blades subsequently struck the ground and the aircraft turned sharply left causing it to tip onto its starboard side.The crew reported that there were no injuries sustained during the accident and subsequent evacuation."
9,ACC2287,"The pilot was receiving a checkride from a designated pilot examiner for his single-pilot type rating in a turbine airplane. After a series of maneuvers, emergencies, and landings, the examiner asked the pilot to complete a no-flap landing. The pilot reported that he performed the Before Landing checklist with no flaps and believed that he had put the gear down. During touchdown, the pilot felt a ""thump"" and thought a tire had blown; however, he saw that the landing gear handle was in the ""up"" position, and he noted that the landing gear warning horn did not sound because he had performed a no-flaps landing. The examiner confirmed that the landing gear handle was in the ""up"" position. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector who examined the airplane reported that the landing gear handle was in the ""up"" position and that the fuselage had sustained substantial damage. The landing gear was lowered and locked into place without issue after the airplane was lifted from the runway."
10,ACC2288,"A privately registered Bombardier Challenger 605, was conducting a flight from Palm Beach International Airport, Florida USA (KPBI) to Calgary Intl., AB (CYYC), with three crew members and 10 passengers on board. During the final descent into CYYC, the flight crew selected flaps 20 and immediately received a flaps fail caution message. The decision was made to abandon the approach, and the crew received clearance from ATC to proceed NW of the CYYC airport and troubleshoot the issue. The crew executed the applicable QRH procedure and subsequently received clearance from ATC to proceed with the landing. A flaps 0 landing was then executed. During the landing roll, after ground spoiler and thrust reverser deployment, the nose of the aircraft attained a significant nose high attitude. The rear fuselage of the aircraft struck the runway, and during the recovery, the nose landing gear subsequently impacted the runway. The aircraft taxied clear of the runway and to the intended parking area. Subsequent inspectionrevealed that the aircraft sustained significant structural damage to the forward fuselage and minor damage to the rear fuselage. There were no injuries."
11,ACC2289,"On 28 February 2020 at 04:50 UTC an Airbus A300B4-203F freighter aircraft, registration UP-A3003, departed Sharjah International Airport (OMSJ), the United Arab Emirates, destined for Juba Airport (HSSJ), South Sudan. There were five crewmembers onboard comprising the captain, the copilot and the flight engineer on the flight deck, together with a loadmaster and an aircraft engineer who were seated in the galley area. The flight was uneventful and the Aircraft landed at 08:45 UTC at HSSJ.Prior to departure, after one hour and 35 minutes on the ground, the captain and the aircraft engineer completed the transit check. The captain noticed oil dripping from the lower fuselage. The aircraft engineer advised the captain that four days before the green hydraulic system tank had been replaced and that the oil was most likely residue from this maintenance action. He assured the captain that the aircraft would be cleaned on arrival in Sharjah.The aircraft departed HSSJ at 10:20 UTC for OMSJ. The departure and flight were uneventful until when at FL350 in the Muscat flight information region (FIR), the captain requested a flight level change due to moderate turbulence. According to his statement, immediately after starting the descent, he received a report from the flight engineer that the fluid level in the yellow hydraulic system had rapidly decreased and the ""HYDRAU"" light had illuminated on the master warning panel, followed by an autopilot disconnect. The checklist items for the hydraulic system loss from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) were followed and the flight continued manually with the captain as the pilot flying (PF). According to the captain, Air Traffic Control (ATC) was not informed of the hydraulic system loss, but that the flight crew prepared for an extended landing distance of 1.2 times the normal landing distance. The aircraft landed at 15:15 UTC at OMSJ on runway 30 and exited on the high-speed taxiway B7.The captain stated that the descent, approach, landing and taxiing to the cargo apron were uneventful, and that the brakes functioned normally. The captain followed the marshallers instructions and stopped the aircraft at the assigned A300 position mark on parking stand 57, in front of the cargo hangar.The captain stated that once the aircraft came to a stop, he applied manual brakes and set the parking brake. While the crew started the parking checklist, the copilot prepared to shut the engines down. When the captain looked up, he realized that the aircraft was moving forward and he applied manual brakes but the aircraft did not stop. He stated that he then steered to the left to avoid the cargo hangar in front of the aircraft but the aircraft continued to move until the No.1 engine collided with a tug which was parked in the equipment area, approximately 36 meters beyond the A300 position mark.An inspection identified that the yellow hydraulic system high-pressure filter housing, located in the lower fuselage, had fractured and leaked hydraulic fluid."
12,ACC2290,"An operator's pilot was conducting training for a newly hired pilot for a first officer position in the twin-engine airplane. After accomplishing air work, the pilots returned to the airport to practice landings and takeoffs. According to both pilots, the first approach was normal, and the airplane touched down slightly right of the runway centerline. The trainee pilot stated that, after touchdown, the airplane began drifting further right and that he was unable to correct the deviation. The trainer pilot reported that, when directional control became unstable, he told the trainee, ""I have the controls."" The trainer pilot saw that the trainee pilot released his hands from the engine power levers and the yoke, but the airplane continued to deviate to the right, contrary to his control inputs and his addition of asymmetric power to the engines. The trainer pilot realized that, based on his inputs, the airplane should have returned to the centerline but that it did not and that it was behaving as if the trainee pilot was applying some braking. At that point, the trainer pilot again told the trainee pilot to release the controls, and he used the brakes, which he reported applied and released normally. Subsequently, the airplane exited the right side of the runway and impacted a ditch. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. The trainer pilot and the operator reported that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The trainer pilot reported that he believed the trainee pilot's feet were either on the brakes or interfered with his brake and/or rudder application attempts. The trainee pilot reported that he could not recall the position of his feet after he relinquished airplane control to the trainer pilot."
13,ACC2291,"Omni Air flight 346, a Boeing 767-300ER, bounced and touched down hard on runway 24 at Shannon Airport, Ireland.There were no injuries and airplane suffered creases all around the forward fuselage."
14,ACC2292,"A DHC-3T Turbine Otter was conducting circuits at Fort Langley (CBQ2), BC. During the second landing on runway 26, the aircraft bounced and started an uncontrolled veer to the left. The aircraft departed the left side of the runway onto the adjacent ramp. The left wing tip contacted a parked trailer causing the aircraft to pivot left and impact a second trailer before coming to an abrupt stop. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. There were no injuries and no post impact fire. The ELT automatically activated and the signal was received."
15,ACC2293,"A Planemaster Ltd Cessna 208B Super Cargomaster, performing cargo flight PMS1670, from Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport (ICT/KICT) to Hays Municipal Airport (HYS/KHYS) crashed in wheat field terrain northwest of La Crosse, Rush County, Kansas.The aircraft took off from ICT at 07:52 local time (12:52 UTC). At 08:25, the HYS automated weather observation service was reporting, in part, winds from 080° at 11 knots, visibility 1 statute mile, and overcast clouds at 200 ft above ground level. The pilot made an ILS approach to runway 34 but was forced to execute a missed approach. The pilot stated to ATC his intention to attempt the ILS approach to runway 34 a second time.At 08:41, the HYS weather indicated that visibility had dropped to 0,25 statute mile in fog. Again, the pilot performed a missed approach.About 08:59 the pilot stated his intention to divert to Great Bend Airport (GBD), Kansas. The airplane began a turn to the south toward GBD while climbing to about 7,000 ft. Around 09:06, the pilot began making unintelligible radio communications that air traffic controllers stated were unreadable. About 09:15, the controller asked the accident pilot if he was turning directly to GBD. After an unintelligible response from the pilot, the controller stated alright plane master sixteen seventy it's very difficult to understand there might be something wrong with uh your cockpit or your pressurization plane master sixteen seventy oxygen oxygen. About a minute later, the pilot was more easily understood.However, about 09:18, ATC made a transmission with no response from the pilot. At the same time the airplane began a descent and left turn. About 09:20, an unintelligible response was received from the accident airplane. ATC then made numerous transmissions to the accident pilot urging him to utilize oxygen and open a window. No further communications were received from the accident airplane.The aircraft was found to have crashed in a field. The airplane's tail and wings were visible above ground, with the forward fuselage and engine section buried several feet under the terrain, consistent with a near-vertical, high-speed impact. The main landing gear was bent aft towards the tail with the left and right main wheel protruding from the ground."
16,ACC2294,"The Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft, registered P2-MAF, owned and operated by Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) PNG Limited, conducting a VFR non-scheduled passenger flight operation from Kompiam to Yenkisa, experienced a runway excursion accident during its landing roll at Yenkisa Airstrip. There were four persons on board; one pilot and three passengers. There were no reported injuries.During final approach into the Yenkisa Airstrip, the pilot was affected by the visual illusion presented by the upslope strip. As a result, the pilot flew too low during the final approach. The pilot stated that during the approach, as the aircraft got closer to strip 31, he realised that he was coming too close to a protruding tree along the approach path and determined that he was too low. He immediately shallowed the descent angle. Subsequent to clearing the tree, the pilot found himself highon approach, passing the strip 31 edge.The pilot steepened the descent angle because he realized that he had overshot the strip 31 edge. During flare, the aircraft floated for some distance due to the excess energy from the steep descent.The aircraft touched down about 200 m beyond the edge of strip 31. During the initial part of the landing roll, because the strip was wet, the aircraft subsequently skid forward. The pilot did not use reverse thrust during the landing roll.The aircraft overran the airstrip, hit a mound of clay and rocks, subsequently tipping left into a gully.The Yenkisa Airstrip is located at an elevation of 3700 ft. Airstrip 13/31 has a Landing Distance Available of 465 m. Landings can only be performed on runway 31 because the runway has a 8.7% down slope to the south-east."
17,ACC2295,"The C-130J-30, assigned to the 37th Airlift Squadron, 86th Airlift Wing at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, conducted a routine periodic evaluation flight for a pilot. The crew flew a maximum effort (assault) landing at Ramstein Air Base and experienced a hard landing with a vertical acceleration load factor (g-load) exceedance value of 3.62 times the force of gravity (g) and a landing sink rate of 834 feet per minute exceeding the  aircrafts maximum allowable landing limits of 540 fpm and g-load of 2.0g. Immediately upon touchdown, the crew executed a go-around and coordinated with Air Traffic Control for a visual approach, full-stop landing. The aircraft landed safely at 17:37.The landing g-load exceedance resulted in significant damage to the center wing, both outer wings, left and right main landing gear assemblies, and engines, to include mounting structures. The estimated damages are $20,917,089.The crew of this mission was scheduled to fly in a formation of three C-130Js planning to conduct two training routes. The primary training objective for the local sortie was to complete the pilots evaluation. The crew planned to takeoff early as a single-ship, conduct a maximum effort takeoff followed by a maximum effort landing using the painted landing zone marked on the runway as required for the evaluation, full-stop, and then rejoin the formation in order to complete the remainder of the evaluation requirements in the formation. Preflight, engine start, taxi and the Ramstein AB visual traffic pattern procedures were executed within good flying standards and were procedurally correct. The mishap occurred during the maximum effort landing."
18,ACC2296,"A Buffalo Airways Beech King Air suffered a runway excursion on landing at Kugaaruk Airport, Canada. At 12:16, the aircraft departed Cambridge Bay Airport for Kugaaruk (CYBB). The first officer was the pilot flying. At 13:19, when the flight was about 80 nautical miles from CYBB at flight level 210, the flight crew called the CYBB community aerodrome radio station. The flight crew received the runway surface condition report and were informed that the winds were from 200° true, at 24 knots gusting to 33 knots. At 13:20, the community aerodrome radio station operator called the flight crew and relayed the CYBB 1300 weather observation, reporting that the horizontal visibility was 1/4 statute mile in light snow and blowing snow and that the vertical visibility was 400 feet. The flight crew noted that the visibility had decreased since their departure from Cambridge Bay but continued the approach. The reported wind would result in a 12-to 16-knot crosswind component from the left on runway 23. The captain took control at 13:27, at the start of the descent, and descent checks were carried out.The captain transferred control back to the first officer at the initial approach waypoint, DATLA, and briefed for a pilot-monitored area navigation (RNAV) approach to runway 23. From the intermediate approach waypoint to the missed approach waypoint the approach is flown on a track of 244°T, which is offset 15° from the runway heading of 229°T. When the runway is acquired visually at or before the minimum descent altitude (MDA), a left turn is required to align the aircraft with the runway heading.During the descent the flight crew activated the runway lights and the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) system via the aircraft radio control of airport lighting system (ARCAL). The captain set the flaps to the approach setting (40%), and the first officer flew the descent. When the captain then confirmed visual contact with the runway, snow was blowing across it at an angle from left to right. The runway itself was apparent as a black shape within the blowing snow; however, the runway lighting and PAPI were not observed. The captain set the flaps to the land setting (100%) and then, as part of the pilot-monitored approach procedure, assumed control of the aircraft as the pilot flying. The first officer looked up from the instruments and observed, through the blowing snow, the runway as well as the community aerodrome radio station and airport apron ahead and off to the left.The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 100 knots indicated airspeed. As the captain flared the aircraft, the first officer warned the captain of snowbanks off to the right side of the runway.At 13:50, when the right main landing gear touched down, the aircraft veered to the right and departed the runway surface. The right wing contacted snowbanks and the aircraft turned approximately 90° to the right before colliding nose first with a high snowbank. Both crew members, who were not injured, exited through the cabin door.The aircraft was substantially damaged; however, the freight remained secure. The emergency locator transmitter (ELT) did not activate and there was no fire."
19,ACC2297,"An Embraer EMB-120RT Brasilia transporting medical supplies crashed on approach to Bardale, Somalia. All six on board were killed.The aircraft had departed Mogadishu and landed at Baidoa before proceeding to Bardale. On board were a captain, copilot, flight engineer and a trainee pilot, and two people working for the airline, according to Somalia's Transport minister.Ethiopian troops were stationed both at Baidoa and at Bardale as part of the Africa Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).In a statement, AMISOM reported that the aircraft was approaching from the west, while the usual landing direction was from the east. Apparently the aircraft then overflew the airfield at a low altitude while going around. A witness reported that there were animals on or near the runway at the time.Ethiopian soldiers believed it was a suicide plane trying to find a target in the base camp. It was then shot down using a ZU-23 anti-aircraft cannon."
20,ACC2298,"A Beechcraft 1900C, N31704, sustained substantial damage when it was involved in an accident at San Antonio Airport, Texas, USA. The pilot sustained no injury. The flight departed the Corpus Christi International Airport (CRP), Texas, at 20:04 with 631 lbs of cargo and a fuel load of 2,800 lbs. During the initial climb, the captain selected the landing gear handle to the UP position to retract the landing gear. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the captain attempted to cycle the landing gear handle once more yielding the same result. Following the second unsuccessful gear retraction, the captain elected to leave the landing gear handle in the DOWN position and continued to the San Antonio International Airport (SAT), Texas, where more services would be available if needed. The airplane climbed to 8,000 ft mean sea level and cruised below the maximum landing gear extended speed (VLE).As the captain began to prepare for arrival at SAT, he retrieved the arrival automatic terminal information service (ATIS). The ATIS was reporting gusting winds out of the north, clear skies, and runway 4 as the active arrival runway. The captain began the descent toward the airport and air traffic control cleared the airplane for the visual approach to runway 4. The pilot entered a dogleg right base and completed the before landing checklist noting three green lights and no red lights, which indicated the landing gear was down, locked, and safe for landing.The airplane touched down around the aiming point marker on runway 4. As the main landing gear touched down on the dry concrete, the left main landing gear collapsed, the red unsafe light in the landing gear handle illuminated, and was followed by an aural horn indicating the landing gear was now unlocked and unsafe for landing. Simultaneously, the airplane began to dip toward the left, causing the left wing tip to contact the runway. The impact on the airplane resulted in the airplane's momentum taking the airplane from the runway centerline off the runway and into the grass area several thousand ft from the runway 4 threshold. Once the airplane came to a complete stop, the captain shutdown all power to the airplane and exited through the main entry air stairs.The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.A postaccident damage assessment by the operator revealed that the left main landing gear brace was fractured."
21,ACC2299,"A Cessna 501, N501KM, sustained substantial damage when it was involved in and accident near Houston, Texas. The pilot was not injured. After a normal instrument flight rules (IFR), 2-hour flight from Gainesville, Florida (GNV), the pilot was setting up to land at his final destination Houston International Airport, Texas (HOU). The pilot reported that during his final approach to runway 13, he lowered the landing gear and received 2 of 3 green lights on his landing gear position indicators. The left main landing gear light was not illuminated and a warning horn sounded. The pilot recycled the landing gear with the same result. He reported the situation to HOU tower and asked if they could visually see whether all three landing gear were down. The pilot stated that the HOU tower affirmed that all three landing gear were down. The pilot also stated that a commercial airliner that was taxiing toward the main terminal radioed that they observed all three landing gear were down.The pilot reported that according to the Pilot Operating Handbook (POH), he initiated an aggressive bank right, followed abruptly by a bank left in an attempt to generate sufficient lateral G-force on the landing gear. The HOU tower asked the pilot his intentions, and the pilot informed them that he would proceed to land. Upon touchdown on runway 13R, the left main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane veered left and came to a stop in a grassy area adjacent to runway 13R and Taxiway Lima, resulting in structural damage to the left wing tip and underbelly of the airplane. The pilot exited the airplane and airport emergency services responded. Recovery personnel manually lifted and locked the left main landing gear down, and the airplane was towed to a hangar facility. The pilot reported that his decision to land was made because the left main landing gear indicator light had malfunctioned in years past, and it was found that the light had malfunctioned, and not the landing gear.An investigation of the incident airplane showed that the internal locking mechanism of left main landing gear actuator was not functioning."
22,ACC2300,"The Lockheed C-130H3 Hercules departed Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait at approximately 20:53 local time. After cruising for approximately 59 minutes, the aircraft began its descent into Camp Taji, Iraq. During descent, the crew leveled off at 3700 feet mean sea level (MSL) and reduced throttles to flight idle. The copilot slowed and configured the aircraft for a night vision device (NVD) approach and landing with flaps set to 100 percent. The aircraft's highest recorded airspeed during this approach was 157 Knots Indicated Air Speed (KIAS), although the maximum recommended airspeed with the wing flaps set to 100 percent is 145 KIAS. At approximately two nautical miles (NM) from the airfield, the aircraft was 1000 feet above the recommended glideslope for runway 34 and at 150 KIAS, and remained above glideslope until landing. The reported tailwind for runway 34 at Camp Taji was 10 knots, with a temperature of 34 degrees Celsius. The aircraft crossed the runway 34 threshold at a ground speed of 161 knots (151 KIAS); the recommended calculated landing velocity for the aircraft at its weight (122,000 pounds) was 105 KIAS.The crew attempted to land the aircraft at higher than optimal speed with a nose-down attitude. The aircraft's excessive air speed continued to generate lift on the aircraft and caused it to porpoise upon touchdown, which prevented the aircraft's braking system from engaging due to a lack of proper weight on the wheels. Thirteen seconds after touchdown -eight seconds of which were spentporpoising- the aircraft began to slow as expected, once the engines were placed in reverse and when the wheels then received adequate weight to engage the anti-skid brakes. However, by that point there was insufficient runway remaining (less than 1000 feet) and the aircraft departed the prepared surface, whereupon it came to a stop only when it struck a 12-foot-high concrete barrier approximately 600 feet past the end of the runway, at approximately 22:05 local time. All 26 individuals onboard the aircraft survived the mishap and egressed, with only relatively minor injuries to two individuals."
23,ACC2301,"DHC-8-402Q G-JECK had been stored at Aberdeen Airport since mid-March 2020, following the previous operator (Flybe) ceasing trading. On 16 June 2020, the aircraft was to be flown empty to Weeze Airport, Germany where it was to be placed back into storage.Prior to boarding the aircraft, the pilots had checked that wheel chocks were fitted to the mainwheels and nosewheels. In the cockpit, the parking brake lever was confirmed as being set to the park position and whilst the commander reviewed the aircraft technical log, the co-pilot started the APU. The pilots checked the cockpit multi-function display (MFD) and noted that the fluid quantities of the hydraulic systems were adequate. Neither pilot noticed what the park brake hydraulic system pressure was indicating on the MFD, but this was not required to be checked until the end of the aircraft power-on checks and prior to starting the first engine.The representative of the aircrafts owner and the dispatcher then proceeded to remove the chocks from all wheels. The pilots, onboard the aircraft, had not seen the chocks being removed. About 15 minutes after the chocks had been removed, the commander exited the aircraft to start his walkaround inspection. This included visual checks of the nosewheel tyres and the park brake accumulator pressure gauge, which indicated about 500 psi. Whilst the commander spoke with the engineers, the co-pilot then carried out a walkaround inspection.Neither pilot had authorised the removal of any wheel chocks, and neither noticed that all the wheel chocks had been removed during the walkaround. As the pilots completed the load sheet, the dispatcher boarded the aircraft via the forward left cabin door and stood near the cockpit entrance. The owner representative then noticed that the aircraft was starting to move forward and shouted to the dispatcher who alerted the pilots. Both pilots applied the toe brakes and the commander moved the park brake lever off and back to park twice, but the aircraft continued to roll forward. The commander recalled that, as the aircraft had started to move, he had noticed that the park brake hydraulic system pressure on the MFD was 0 psi. The commander also tried to steer using the tiller, but the aircraft did not respond.Having seen the aircraft start to move, the three engineers left their vehicle and ran to the adjacent right landing gear, where they tried to stop the aircraft by pushing and pulling against its main strut. As the representative ran to the vehicle to get some chocks, the dispatcher jumped from the cabin door and moved to the left gear where he pushed against its strut. However, the aircraft continued to gather speed as it crossed Taxiway D whilst heading towards the parked and empty aircraft, Embraer ERJ-145EP G-SAJS. The dispatcher then ran to the front of the aircraft, where he was joined by one of the engineers, who tried to slow the aircraft by pushing against the aircraft nose. A few second later, the engineers and dispatcher ran clear of G-JECK as it approached G-SAJS.At a ground speed of about 5 kt, G-JECK struck the underside of G-SAJS's No 2 engine, causing its right landing gear to be lifted clear of the ground. G-JECK came to a stop with the No 2 engine of G-SAJS resting on top of its forward fuselage. There were no injuries."

25,ACC2303,"A Beechcraft 200 operated by Skyjet Aviation as flight 443, was on a flight with a under instrument flight rules from Québec City-Jean Lesage Airport, Canada, with destination Rouyn Airpor  with 2 crew members and 8 passengers on board.When the landing gear was retracted on departure from Québec, the crew heard a noise, but this didn't seem to be a concern. On approach to runway 26 at Rouyn, when the landing gear handle was activated to extend the landing gear, there was no effect. The approach was aborted and the emergency checklist was completed. The crew attempted to extend the gear manually, but no pressure was felt in the emergency lever and the gear did not extend. A second attempt was made and the nose gear was extended and locked, but there was no pressure left in the hand pump to completely deploy the main gear. A low approach was flown so ground personnel could check the position of the undercarriage. All three wheels appeared to be down and the crew declared an emergency prior to landing on runway 26. Touchdown was normal, but when the airspeed reached approximately 60 knots, the right main gear collapsed, followed by the left main gear. The aircraft was evacuated and no one was hurt. An inspection of the aircraft found the landing gear system circuit breaker was in the pulled position."
26,ACC2304,"An Antonov An-2R, RA-71276, was reported missing on a flight from Kyren, Buryatia, Russia.

27,ACC2305,"The Beechjet 400A, N425BJ, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at Montgomery Regional Airport (MGM), Alabama, USA. The two pilots were not injured. According to the pilot, after extending the landing gear he did not receive a positive indication that the left main landing gear was down and locked. After emergency procedures failed to extend the gear, the pilot elected to shut down the left engine and land with the left main landing gear retracted.Initial examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to the left wing and that the left main landing gear door would not open."
28,ACC2306,A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan suffered a runway excursion after landing at Holbox Airstrip. The right-hand wing impacted a small concrete building and suffered serious damage at the wing root. The five passengers and two pilots survived the crash.The Holbox Airstrip is 650 m long.
29,ACC2307,"An Antonov An-74TK-100 transport plane, operating for the United Nations, suffered an accident on landing at Gao Airport, Mali.The aircraft operated flight UNO 052P from Bamako to Gao, Mali. There were 7 crew members on board the aircraft and 4 passengers (representatives of the UN mission).While en route, about 1 hr. 10 min after takeoff, the right engine generator failed. The captain initiated a descent and attempted to start the APU. At that moment the left engine generator failed as well. Two attempts to start the APU failed.After about 20 minutes of flight, the batteries were completely discharged, which led to a complete loss of power supply on board the aircraft.The crew continued the flight to Gao in VFR under the clouds. Landing approach at Gao was performed visually. Due to the on board powerloss, the flaps remained retracted.The aircraft touched down at a distance of about 500 m from threshold of runway 25. Due to the power failure, the thrust reverser could not be used. The aircraft could not be stopped on the runway and overran, coming to rest 389 meters past the end of the runway. Two crew members were injured, other crew members and passengers were not injured."

This aircraft was recently acquired by Gateway Export Aviation, an operator from D.R. Congo. The operator stated that the owner of the aircraft had misappropriated the aircraft for use by South West Aviation. Gateway reported that at the time of the accident the aircraft was loaded with 8 tons of cargo, whereas 5,5 tons would be the maximum."
31,ACC2309,"A Swearingen SA227-AC airplane, N362AE, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at the San AntonioInternational Airport (SAT), Texas. According to the pilot, the airplane yawed right while on final approach to runway 13L, but he was able to regain control of the airplane with a left rudder input and continued with the landing approach. The airplanes wings remained level, the nose aligned with the runway heading, and on a normal glidepath to the runway until the airplane crossed over the runway threshold. Shortly after the pilot began reducing engine power for a landing, the airplane began to roll right wing down and that the roll became more pronounced as the landing flare continued. The pilot stated that he was unable to regain control of the airplane before it landed hard on the right main landing gear with the airplane banked about 20° right wing down. The airplane departed off the right side of the runway where the nose landing gear collapsed. The lower fuselage and forward pressure bulkhead were substantially damaged during the hard landing."

The aircraft carried cadets of the Kharkiv University of the Air Force on a training flight. The aircraft had made six successful take-offs and five successful landings. Shortly after the sixth takeoff the crew noticed a pressure drop in the left engine torque sensor, and reported this to the air traffic controller. It was decided to turn back to the airport to land.While on final approach to runway 16 the aircraft suddenly turned sharply to the left and crashed at the side of the road, about 1800 m from the runway. A fire broke out. Two of the 27 occupants survived the crash, but one survivor later died of his injuries."
33,ACC2311,"The Douglas C-54E cargo plane suffered a runway excursion after landing at Yakataga Intermediate Airport, Alaska, USA.The pilot reported that the flight had been delayed for ""nearly 2 weeks due to rain"" but that the company had contacted their customer, who was a local resident of the area, and he had reported that the landing grass airstrip was ""currently dry"".While landing on the airstrip, the braking action was zero along the entire length of the runway. Subsequently, while about 5 knots, the airplane overran the end of the runway, and the nose landing gear collapsed. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage.A NOTAM had been issued, which stated, in part, that the landing runway was closed to aircraft that weighed more than 5,000 lbs.

They had the runway in sight approximately 3 miles out. The pilot reduced thrust to idle power at 50 ft above ground level and touched down on speed, centerline, and on aim point. The copilot then deployed speed brakes at approximately 97 knots.The pilot applied the brakes and then stated he was getting no braking feel. The airplane was not decelerating normally. The copilot selected antiskid off; however, there was no improvement in braking action.The pilot managed to ""scrub off"" some groundspeed by steering to the left and right sides of the runway before the airplane departed the end of the runway. The airplane stopped approximately 150 ft past the runway in soft soil and grass."
36,ACC2314,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 suffered an airstrip excursion during takeoff from Wobagen Airstrip, Papua New Guinea. That morning, the crew had flown to Wobagen on a passenger and cargo charter flight, landing at 08:47. Once on ground, the crew took passengers on board the aircraft and loaded cargo, to conduct a VFR charter flight to Bak Airstrip, located 3.8 nm north-east of Wobagen.At about 09:13, upon reaching the threshold of strip 12, the captain, who was Pilot Flying, conducted a 180° turn and applied maximum power, transitioning from taxi into take-off roll.The crew stated that after applying maximum power, the aircraft had a tendency to veer to the right. The captain tried to maintain the aircraft on centreline by using asymmetric thrust, however, as the aircraft accelerated down the strip, the tendency to veer right increased. About 154m down the strip, the aircraft began veering towards the right and tracked away from the centreline. As the aircraft passed the strip boundary (cone markers), with a recorded groundspeed of 40kt the crew aborted the take-off; power to idle and applied full brakes. The aircraft continued forward and veering right. Four seconds later, the aircraft impacted a drain.The nosewheel subsequently separated from the fork causing the nose to drop and the nose gear subsequently collapsed. The momentum of the aircraft caused it to continue another 8m with the nose dragging across the ground before it impacted the right edge drain.Wobagen Airstrip is a 600 m long airstrip (12/30) with a slope of 8° to the southeast.

38,ACC2316,"An Airco Aircraft Charters Ltd. Beech A100, was operating as flight 128 from Edmonton (CYEG), AB to Kelowna (CYLW), BC with 2 crew and 3 passengers and 2000 pounds of fuel on board. The flight departed CYEG utilizing runway 20 at 14:15 MST. After departure, the flight crew selected the landing gear up. The gear in transit light illuminated and the two green main landing gear indicator lights extinguished, but the nose landing gear green light remained illuminated. The crew requested and received a block of airspace from air traffic services to trouble shoot the issue. The flight crew subsequently selected the landing gear down, to which they heard some abnormal mechanical sounds and the status of the landing gear indication lights remained unchanged. The captain elected to perform a flyby of the control tower in an attempt to get visual confirmation of the landing gear position. The tower reported that the landing gear appeared to be in the extended position. The flight crew then completed the manual extension of the landing gear in accordance with the abnormal procedures, but was unable to cycle the manual extension handle. The flight crew informed the passengers that they would be returning to CYEG and conducted a passenger briefing as there was a concern the landing gear was not fully extended and may collapse/retract on landing. At approximately 1505 local time, an approach and touch down on runway 20 was subsequently conducted. The captain felt the left side main landing gear collapsing and executed a go around. The flight crew then requested and received permission to enter a hold for further troubleshooting. Company maintenance was contacted and the decision was made to execute an emergency landing. At approximately 15:15 MST the aircraft landedrunway 20, the left main landing gear collapsed and the aircraft came to a rest near taxiway B1.Passengers and crew evacuated out the main cabin entrance door. There were no injuries and there was no fire.Subsequent inspection by company maintenance personnel found a taper pin for the nose landing gear drive sprocket and right main landing gear driveshaft not installed in the right side output shaft of the landing gear gearbox. This resulted in the landing gears becoming unsynchronized."
39,ACC2317,"A Cessna 560 Citation V, registration N3RB, was destroyed when it impacted the terrain in the Mutton Mountains area southeast of Pine Grove, Oregon. The pilot was killed in the accident.The aircraft departed Troutdale Airport, Oregon at 22:08 UTC. After departure, while in contact with  Portland Approach and subsequently Seattle Center, the pilot had problems following the controllers' instructions with regards to  headings and radio frequency.The aircraft was cleared to climb to FL370 by Seattle Center and continued to climb, until 13:28:45, when it reached its highest altitude of 31,000 ft. The airplane began to descend, and remained for the next eight minutes in a spiraling and descending 1-mile radius right turn. The last ADS-B target was recorded at 13:36:27, with the airplane on a northwest heading at an altitude of 3,800 ft. The airplane struck the ground in the Mutton Mountain Range, at an elevation of 3,600 ft. FAA records did not indicate that the pilot held a type rating for the Citation 560. He had taken Citation 560 training toward the end of 2020 at a training facility in Arizona, however the owner of the facility stated that the pilot had not performed to a level sufficient to be issued a type rating or single pilot exemption. During the training, he struggled significantly in high workload environments and had difficulty operating the airplanes avionics suite, which had recently been installed. He revealed to a fellow pilot that he preferred to hand fly the airplane rather than use the autopilot.Review of historical flight data, and statements provided by acquaintances of the pilot, indicate that this was likely the first time he had flown the airplane on his own."
40,ACC2318,"West Atlantic UK flight NPT05L, a Boeing 737-400 cargo plane, suffered substantial damage during a hard landing at Exeter Airport, U.K.The takeoff and climb from East Midlands Airport (EMA) proceeded without event. During the cruise the crew independently calculated the landing performance. Runway 26 at Exeter Airport (EXT) was forecast to be wet, so they planned to use Flap 40 for the landing, with Autobrake 3. With both pilots being familiar with EXT the co-pilot, who was Pilot Flying (PF), conducted a short brief of the pertinent points for the approach. From the ATIS they noted that the weather seemed to be better than forecast and the surface wind was from 230° at 11 kt. The ATC provided the flight crew with radar vectors from ATC to the ILS on Runway 26 at EXT.The landing gear was lowered and Flap 25 selected before the aircraft intercepted the glideslope. Flap 40 (the landing flap) was selected on the glideslope just below 2000 ft amsl. With a calculated VREF of 134 kt and a surface wind of 10 kt the PF planned to fly the approach with a VAPP of 140 kt. At about 10 nm finals, upon looking at the flight management computer, the captain, who was Pilot Monitoring (PM), noticed there was a 30 kt headwind, so a VAPP of 144 kt was selected on the Mode Control Panel (MCP). The crew became visual with the runway at about 1000 ft aal. The PF then disconnected the Auto Pilot and Auto Throttle; the Flight Directors remained on.As the wind was now starting to decrease, the VAPP was then reduced from 142 to 140 kt at about 600 ft aal.As the wind reduced, towards the 10 kt surface wind, the PF made small adjustments to the power to maintain the IAS at or close to VAPP. At 500 ft radio altimeter (RA) the approach was declared stable by the crew, as per their standard operating procedures. At this point the aircraft had a pitch attitude of 2.5° nose down, the IAS was 143 kt, the rate of descent (ROD) was about 860 ft/min, the engines were operating at about 68% N1 and the aircraft was 0.4 dots above the glideslope. However, the ROD was increasing and soon thereafter was in excess of 1,150 ft/min. This was reduced to about 300 ft/min but soon increased again.At 320 ft RA, the aircraft went below the glideslope for about 8 seconds and, with a ROD of 1,700 ft/min, a 'SINK RATE' GPWS alert was enunciated. The PF acknowledged this and corrected the flightpath to bring the aircraft back to the glideslope before stabilizing slightly above the glideslope; the PM called this deviation too. As the PF was correcting back to the glideslope the PM did not feel there was a need to take control. During this period the maximum recorded deviation was 3/4 of a dot below the glideslope.At about 150 ft RA, with a ROD of 1,300 ft/min, there was a further 'SINK RATE' GPWS alert, to which the PM said, 'watch that sink rate ', followed by another 'Sink Rate' alert, which the PF responded by saying 'and back...'The commander recalled that as the aircraft crossed the threshold, at about 100 ft, the PF retarded the throttles, pitched the aircraft nose down, from about 5° nose up to 4° nose down, and then applied some power in the last few feet. During these final moments before the landing, there was another 'Sink Rate' alert. The result was a hard landing. A 'Pull Up' warning was also triggered by the GPWS, but it was not audible on the CVR.The last surface wind transmitted by ATC, just before the landing, was from 230° at 10 kt. During the rollout the commander took control, selected the thrust reversers and slowed down to taxi speed. After the aircraft had vacated the runway at Taxiway Bravo it became apparent the aircraft was listing to the left. During the After Landing checks the co-pilot tried to select Flaps Up, but they would not move. There was then a Hydraulic LP caution. As there was still brake accumulator pressure the crew were content to taxi the aircraft slowly the short distance onto Stand 10. Once on stand the listing became more obvious.It was then that the crew realised there was something 'seriously wrong' with the aircraft. After they had shut the aircraft down, the flight crew requested that the wheels were chocked, and the aircraft be connected to ground power before going outside to inspect the aircraft. Once outside a hydraulic leak was found. The fuselage skin aft of the wings was cracked and buckled, and the rear fuselage was distorted downward. The crown skin was creased and rippled along most of the fuselage. Both main landing gear shock absorbers were found to be bottomed, and the left main landing gear beam was distorted upwards such that the aircraft was approximately 2° left-wing low. he flap drive mechanism was damaged, and the left-wing inboard driveshaft was bent; the left inboard gearbox casing and its mountings were broken.The maximum vertical acceleration recorded by the FDR on touchdown was 3.8g, at this point there was 3° of left roll."

49,ACC2327,"The Cessna 208B aircraft, registered PK-MAD was being operated by Yayasan Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) Indonesia on an unscheduled cargo flight from Wamena Airport (WAVV), Papua to Angguruk Airstrip, Papua. The filed flight plan indicated that the flight would be conducted under the Visual Flight Rule (VFR).At 09:08 LT, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed from Wamena. The pilot was the only person on board the aircraft and this flight was the second flight of the day for the pilot and the aircraft. Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction.Considering that the aircraft altitude was higher than normal for the landing approach to runway 09 at Angguruk and attempting to avoid clouds, the pilot made several maneuvers over Angguruk. During that maneuver, the pilot noticed that the grass on the runway, about 50 meters from beginning of the runway 09 and the grass about 30 meters before the threshold of runway 09 had brighter color than the other grass. The pilot thought that the brighter color-grass was the grass that had been cut.When on final approach, the pilot noticed that the runway threshold markers were visible. The pilot recalled that the markers did not stand out as usual due to the color. The pilot also recalled that the area about 30 meters before the threshold runway 09 looked usable for landing, as the color was no different with the 50 meters of the beginning runway. The pilot planned to make touchdown in the very beginning of runway 09 as he did not want to use more braking to decelerate the aircraft.The aircraft touched down about 22 meters before the runway threshold, then veered to the left and stopped about 112 meters from the beginning runway 09 on heading 182°.No one injured in this occurrence and the aircraft was substantially damaged."
50,ACC2328,"Aircraft aborted takeoff due to crosswind and icy conditions and veered off runway tipping over on the wing.The pilot reported to the NTSB that, while back-taxiing for departure, on a snow-and-ice-covered runway in a strong crosswind, the airplane began to slide towards the left side of the runway. He corrected for the slide back towards the runway center line, but the airplane encountered a ""violent gust of wind"" and began to slide again. He applied right brake and right rudder while leaving in full right aileron, but the airplane had zero braking action. As the airplane continued to slide, he applied engine power in an attempt to increase the rudder authority and ""correct the direction back towards the runway"" to no avail. Subsequently, the airplane slid off the left side of the runway, the left wheel impacted a snowbank, and the airplane tipped to the left. The airplane came to rest in a nose down attitude, banked to the left at about a 40° angle, and sustained substantial damage to the left wing and aileron.The pilot added that the weather at the accident airport, about the time of the accident, was wind from 120° at 20 knots. The pilot was back taxiing on runway 20."
51,ACC2329,"A Kazakh Border Service Antonov An-26 crashed at Almaty Airport, killing four of the six occupants. The aircraft crashed about 600 m short of the threshold of runway 23R and burst into flames. Weather at the time of the accident was poor with overcast clouds at 300 feet (91 meters), a visibility of 5 km with light freezing drizzle and mist."
52,ACC2330,"A Cessna 208B, N215MC, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Fairbanks, Alaska. The pilot and 4 passengers were not injured. The pilot reported that, he had brushed off the snow on the airplane before refueling the airplane. The passengers then boarded the airplane, and he readied the airplane for departure. During the takeoff roll, the engine gauges were in the green and everything seemed normal. During climb out, he began to retract the flaps, and while raising the last 10°, the engine began to run rough. The pilot elected to abort the landing, and reduced engine power and lowered the nose toward the runway. The airplane subsequently landed hard, bounced, and came to a stop off the runway. The left main landing gear wasdamaged along with the left side fuselage, which sustained substantial damage. The passengers stated that after the airplane lifted off the runway, the engine sputtered, and then the airplane touched back down on the runway. It bounced 3 or 4 times before it came to a stop.Postaccident examination of the engine, which included an engine run by the operator, revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A fuel sample was tested, with no discrepancies noted.Ground witnesses reported heavy snowfall and a buildup of snow on the airplane. Witnesses further reported that there were no wing covers on the wings. They also reported that the pilot had brushed off an accumulation of snow before departing."
53,ACC2331,"The Cessna 550 Citation II collided with two deer just after rotation at Charleston Executive Airport, SC.The pilot continued the climbout and assessed that the flight controls functioned normally, but that the airplane was having issues with pressurization, and he was unable to communicate via radio. He eventually was able to contact air traffic control via mobile phone to coordinate their arrival at the destination and landed there uneventfully. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that it had sustained substantial damage to the right wing and its pressure vessel during the collision with the deer. Sunset had occurred 38 minutes before the incident at the non-towered airport."
54,ACC2332,"The Gulfstream G150 jet landed long and overran runway 36 into marsh. The right-hand main landing gear separated.The pilot stated to the NTSB that the airplane touched down normally, about 700 to 1,000 ft beyond the runway threshold at a speed between 120-128 knots. He applied brakes and thrust reversers but did not observe an indication that the spoilers deployed. He further recalled that the brakes and thrust reversers were not slowing the airplane. He increased thrust reverser input and asked the copilot to apply ""full brakes."" The airplane subsequently overran the departure end of the runway, traveled through the grass and came to rest in a wetland marsh.After the airplane came to rest, the pilot secured the engines while the copilot performed the shutdown procedures, the crew and passengers exited the airplane through the forward entry door and right overwing emergency exit."
55,ACC2333,"The main landing gear collapsed after landing at Laytamak Airstrip, Russia."
56,ACC2334,"Alpine Air Express flight 5A1855, a Beechcraft 1900C, made a gear-up landing at Denver International Airport, CO (DEN).The pilot stated that, on final approach, he lowered the landing gear, placed the propeller controls forward, confirmed that the landing gear position indicator lights illuminated green, and completed the before landing checklist. He stated that he felt the drag associated with the gear being extended, but the airplane was not slowing as much as usual. As the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the pilot heard radio transmissions from the controller and another airplane to check the landing gear configuration, and he stated that he saw three green lights. He reported that the landing was smooth and felt normal; however, the airplane settled onto the runway and within a few seconds, the propellers impacted the ground.Airport surveillance video indicated that the airplane's landing gear remained fully retracted during the approach and over the runway just before touchdown. Postaccident examination of the landing gear and landing gear indicating/warning system revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's failure to properly configure the landing gear before landing."
57,ACC2335,"A Cessna 208B Supervan 900, registration N103AN, suffered a nose landing gear collapse while taxiing after landing at Wiener Neustadt West Air Base, Austria. All 5 propeller blades separated after the prop struck the ground.The aircraft was engaged in dropping skydivers and had just returned."

59,ACC2337,"IndiGo flight 7979, an ATR 72-600 suffered two burst tyres on the nose landing gear while landing at Hubli Airport, India.The captain of the flight was Pilot Flying, the copilot was Pilot Monitoring.During approach to Hubli, the aircraft was cleared to land on runway 26. The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced four times. All four touchdowns were hard, the first was a three point landing and on the subsequent three landings, the nose landing gear touched the runway first. After the fourth touchdown the crew initiated a go-around. During the go-around, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed 20 seconds. However, this went unnoticed by the crew. Subsequently, when the landing gears were selected up, the landing gear unsafe indication cleared automatically. Thereafter, the aircraft climbed as per instructions of ATC Hubli and entered a holding pattern.During the second approach to the same runway 26, when the landing gears were selected down, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed again, which was noticed by the crew. As there were three green indications on the primary display and one red indication for the nose landing gear on on the overhead panel, the crew disregarded the unsafe indication as per QRH procedure. Checklists were carried out and the landing phase was initiated. After second approach, the aircraft again touched down on runway 26 and bounced consecutively three times, before coming to rest on the runway after the fourth touchdown."
60,ACC2338,"A Let L-410UVP aircraft was destroyed in an accident after takeoff from Tanay Airfield, Kemerovo Region, Russia. The aircraft was operating the fourth flight of the day, carrying skydivers.Preliminary information suggests the no.2 engine failed shortly after takeoff. The aircraft impacted a field when the pilot attempted to turn back."
61,ACC2339,"A Cessna 208B Supervan 900 skydiving aircraft suffered a loss of engine power shortly after takeoff from Teuge Airport, the Netherlands. The pilot performed a forced landing in a field 2 km west of Teuge Airport next to the A50 motorway. The right wing impacted a billboard and the aircraft swung while coming to a stop against a crash barrier next to the highway.On the morning of the accident, the aircraft was parked inside the hangar of a maintenance organisation for a maintenance task before the planned flights that day. When the aircraft was on ground with the engine off, erratic and high engine Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) readings were reported. The maintenance organisation suspected a faulty magnetic pick-up in the engines propeller governor to be the cause of these erratic EGT readings. A mechanic under supervision of a licenced engineer was tasked to replace the magnetic pick-up. After removal of the old magnetic pick-up, the mechanic followed steps one through four of the maintenance manual to install the new magnetic pick-up. Steps five through eight, a system voltage test to check correct installation, were not noticed by the mechanic and as a result not carried out. After connecting the wiring and tightening the lock nut, the mechanic, together with the pilot, did a static engine test run and performed the Single Red Line (SRL) check to verify the system and EGT readings.After the system was found to be functioning correctly, the mechanic left the aircraft and the pilot taxied to the skydive organisations building to pick up parachutists. Following the boarding of seventeen parachutists, the pilot taxied to runway 26 and commenced the takeoff roll. Shortly after takeoff, without any warning, the engine lost power at approximately 400 feet above field level. The pilot made an emergency landing in a field whereby the aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, landing gear and propeller. One parachutist suffered minor injuries."

C-FKFL, another Convair CV-440 operated by Conair, was not operating and was parked at the north end of the tanker base near Taxiway C. As Tanker 455 was taxiing northbound for departure towards Taxiway C its left wingtip contacted the left wing of C-FKFL. There were no injuries. C-FHKF received minor damage. C-FKFL received substantial damage."
63,ACC2341,"An 18-year old male passenger got up from his seat as the Cessna Caravan was approaching Aniak Airport, Alaska. He attempted to take over control by pushing the right-hand control wheel forward. At that time the aircraft was  5 miles from the airport at an altitude of 1000 to 1500 feet.The pilot was able to regain control of the aircraft with the assistance of passengers who pulled the passenger away.Alaska State Troopers arrested the passenger and later reported he was suicidal."
64,ACC2342,"A float-equipped Cessna 208 aircraft (C-GIGO), operated by Seair Seaplanes Ltd., was preparing to conduct a flight from Ganges Harbour, BC to Vancouver Airport, BC with 1 crew member on board. Prior to the engine starting, the dockhand assisting the pilot untied the guide rope and held it in his hand. When the engine started the aircraft travelled forward pulling the rope from the dockhand. The aircraft began travelling forward until the propeller of C-GIGO struck the rear of a float-equipped DHC-3T (C-GUTW) operated by Harbour Air. After the initial prop strike, the pilot of C-GIGO quickly shut down the engine as the aircraft rotated 90 degrees striking C-GUTW with the right-hand wing. C-GUTW was tied to the dock with no one on board during the occurrence. There were no injuries; both aircraft sustained substantial damage."
65,ACC2343,"The pilot was scheduled to operate about 20 parachuting sorties from Old Sarum Airfield (EGLS), where the parachutists landed on the airfield. The weather was good with a wind from 030° at 9 kt and runway 06 was in use.During these flights, the pilot wore a full-face oxygen mask and did not secure the shoulder straps on the five-point harness. He took an A5 sized metal kneeboard that he used to record details of each flight. This was kept under his backpack-style flight bag on the right seat, the flight bag being secured by routing the seats harness through the bags straps.The first 13 flights were uneventful, with the pilot taking a rest after the eleventh flight.During some of these earlier flights the pilot was informed, over the radio by the Drop Zone (DZ) controller, that gliders had been seen circling to the south of the airfield, but the pilot was unable to visually acquire them.The next flight proceeded without event until the post-drop descent. Prior to the descent the DZ controller advised the pilot that gliders had now been seen to the south-west of the airfield. Mindful that he had not seen any of them, and conscious that they seemed to be moving clockwise around the airfield, he decided to fly a shorter final approach path to keep the aircraft closer to the airfield and further from the gliders, rather than potentially come into conflict with the gliders during the approach and landing. The pilot thus extended his initial descent further than on the previous flights, delaying the turn downwind, with the aim of being lower abeam the threshold of runway 06 than previously. Given the shorter final approach path, he planned to land at the beginning of runway 06, rather than slightly deeper on the flatter section, as he had done on the earlier landings. While descending on the downwind leg, the kneeboard slipped out from under the backpack into the right footwell. The pilot initially dismissed this as a minor event and continued with the circuit, which included configuring the aircraft for landing once abeam the threshold.However, on the final approach he became concerned that the kneeboard posed a possible hazard in the form of a potential restriction of the rudder pedals as he landed on the 18 m wide runway. At about 200 ft aal, having checked that the aircraft was on an appropriate flight path, he reached down to pick up the kneeboard from the footwell.Upon looking up, after retrieving the kneeboard, the aircraft was a lot lower than expected. As a result, the pilot abruptly pitched the aircraft up in a bid to arrest the rate of descent (ROD). He described this as a ""lifesaving manoeuvre"". The aircraft touched down very hard in a field about 2 m short of the airfield boundary. It then crossed a berm that borders the airfield, at which point the nosewheel began to oscillate before collapsing. The aircraft came to rest soon thereafter within the lateral confines of the runway.After the aircraft came to rest, the pilot secured the engine and aircraft systems and completed the normal shutdown items. The pilot exited the aircraft unassisted using the pilots side door. Once outside he noticed that the flaps were up and wondered whether he had not lowered them for the landing.The aircraft was damaged beyond economical repair."
66,ACC2344,"A Bombardier CL-600-2B16 Challenger 605 jet, registration N605TR, was destroyed when it impacted heavily wooded terrain while on a visual approach to runway 11 near Truckee Airport (TRK/KTRK), Truckee, California.  The two pilots and four passengers were fatally injured.The flight crew established communication with the Truckee tower controller when they were near the LUMMO waypoint, located about 9.6 nm north of the approach end of runway 20. The tower controller offered the flight crew the option of crossing over the field and enter the left downwind leg for runway 29 or to enter downwind leg for runway 11. Once the flight crew announced they were making a right turn and reported runway 11 in sight, the controller then cleared them to land on runway 11 and informed them that the airplane was not in sight. The flight crew acknowledged the clearance, which was their final radio communication.According to witnesses, the airplane was in a nose down attitude and steep left turn during its last few seconds of flight. The aircraft struck trees and then the ground. The airplane was consumed by postcrash fire."
67,ACC2345,"A Cessna 208 Supervan skydiving plane, D-FLEC, was destroyed when it impacted the waters of the Wadden Sea near Norderney island, Germany. The sole pilot onboard was fatally injured.At 12:54 hrs local time, the pilot took off from Borkum Airfield. On board were the pilot and 12 skydivers, which were dropped at FL 140 above Norderney Island. It was planned to drop the skydivers, land at Norderney Airfield, pick them up again and then fly back to Borkum.At about 13:05 hrs, after the airplane had reached the dropping altitude above Norderney Airfield on a westerly heading, ground speed decreased to marginally below 100 kt and the skydivers were dropped. One minute later, in agreement with the radar controller, the airplane began a left-hand descent turn to a south-easterly heading and started to decrease altitude. Mean rate of descent was 4,000 ft/min and mean ground speed 160 kt. At 13:07 hrs at FL 90, the pilot signed off with the radar controller. At the time, the airplane reached the main land on a south-eastern heading. The descent was conducted as drawn-out left-hand turn in order to overfly the dyke on a north-western heading towards Norderney. Once he reached the Wadden Sea again, the pilot began to decrease rate of descent and speed and radioed Norderney Airfield for the base leg of runway 26.At 13:09:49 hrs, the airplane was last captured as secondary radar signal at 232 ft AMSL with a ground speed of about 150 kt by military radar.Several witnesses, who were on land, at the island or close by on the water, told about an airplane flying with high speed low above the mud flat. One witness, who was on his boat in close proximity, observed the approach and crash. He stated that the airplane had flown into the water in swift straight flight with consistent engine and propeller noises and a pitch angle of about 30°. Immediately after the impact it had overturned and come to rest in the water some hundred meters past the impact point."
68,ACC2346,"Wright Air Service flight 440, a Cessna 208B, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an inflight upset near Fairbanks, Alaska. The pilot and eight passengers were not injured. According to the accident pilot, flight 440 departed about 14:24 from the Fairbanks International Airport (FAI), destined for Huslia, Alaska (HLA), located about 220 miles east-northeast of FAI. After departure, she climbed the airplane to her assigned altitude of 10,000 ft mean sea level (MSL), where she encountered what she described as light rime icing conditions. In an effort to exit the icing conditions, she asked and was assigned a block altitude from 10,000 - 12,000 ft msl, and subsequently climbed the airplane to 10,500 ft msl. Unable to exit the icing conditions, she elected to begin a gradual descent back to 10,000 ft msl. She added that instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and that the autopilot was engaged. The pilot also noted that while en route, the airplanes deicing boots, and heated propeller were operating normally by removing ice accumulations.She said that while in a gradual descent from 10,500 ft. msl to 10,000 ft. msl, the autopilot suddenly disengaged, without warning, and the airplane entered an abrupt uncommand right bank followed by a steep nose down, spiraling descent. The pilot said that it felt as if the aileron controls were jammed as she tried to regain control of the airplane. After regaining control of the airplane, she declared an inflight emergency and subsequently made an emergency landing at FAI.A review of preliminary flight track data revealed that after departing FAI, the flight proceeded to the west, northwest for about 47 nm, cruising at about 10,000 ft msl. Prior to the upset, a climb was initiated and the flight reached an altitude of about 10,700 ft msl before descending to about 10,300 ft msl followed by abrupt changes to altitude and ground speed.A postflight inspection of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the right aileron. Flight control continuity was established continuously from each control surface to the corresponding cockpit controls.Although the airplane was equipped for flight into known icing conditions, the pilots operating handbook (POH) contained information that flight in freezing rain, freezing drizzle, mixed conditions, or conditions defined as severe were prohibited. In addition, the minimum speed for flight in icing conditions with the flaps up was 130 knots indicated airspeed with a maximumweight of 8,550 lbs. The POH further required that the autopilot be disconnected once every 10 minutes in icing conditions to check for any out-of-trim conditions caused by ice buildup.Data obtained from the autopilot revealed that it was not disconnected every 10 minutes through the course of the flight as required. The indicated air speed was consistently below 130 knots, and it was below 100 knots in the seconds preceding the upset. Furthermore, the low airspeed alert activated at 107 kts about 16 minutes, 5 minutes and 2 1/2 minutes before the upset, respectively. Additionally, the estimated gross weight of the airplane at the time of the accident was about 293.5 lbs over its maximum approved gross weight and 805.5 lbs over its approved maximum gross weight for flight in known icing conditions."
69,ACC2347,"A Raytheon 390, N351CW, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident in Naples Airport, FL (APF).The pilot and three passengers and two dogs were not injured. According to the pilot, the flight from Indianapolis International Airport (IND), Indiana to Naples Municipal Airport (APF), Florida was uneventful. During landing runway 23 [6,600' long], he applied normal braking and the airplane started to slow down. Suddenly the brakes ""faded away,"" and he was unable to stop the airplane. He further described that he applied full braking pressure and the pedals were operating as they should, but the airplane was not stopping. He further stated that every few feet the brakes would grab, lock-up for a few feet, and then release. The brakes grabbed several times during the landing roll but were not slowing the airplane down. The airplane overran the end of the runway, and the pilot steered the airplane into the grass and away from a jet blast fence.The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings during the runway excursion."
70,ACC2348,"A Let L-410UVP-E20 was destroyed when it crashed in a forest about 4 km short of the runway near Kazachinskoye Airport (UITK).There were two pilots and 14 passengers onboard. The co-pilot and 3 passengers were killed. The aircraft was owned and operated by Aeroservice, but according to Russian media, the flight was a combined flight for Aeroservice and SiLA (Siberian Light Aviation).The flight from Irkutsk to Kazachinskoye was scheduled to depart at 14:35 but had been delayed for several hours. Kazachinskoye Airport is intended for VFR flights only, since it was not equipped with radio navigational equipment and did not have instrument approach procedures. The airport had non-certified lighting equipment. The flight departed late and arrived in the area of Kazachinskoye around 22:30 hours in darkness. Fog was present, causing two attempted approaches to runway 04 to be aborted.  The first go-around was made from an altitude of about 130 m, the second - from a height of less than 10 m.  After climbing to about 400 m above the runway level, the third approach was performed, this time to runway 22, with the autopilot on, landing gear extended and flaps retracted. At 22:51 local time, the plane, deviating 1100 m to the right from the landing course, collided with trees on the slope of a hill 3 km north of the runway 22 at an altitude of 400 m above sea level. It fell into the forest and broke up. There was no fire."
71,ACC2349,"During a post-flight inspection at Charleston Executive Airport, South Carolina, USA, it was discovered that the no.1 (left) engine cowling had separated, damaging the fuselage, left horizontal stabilizer and left elevator trim.The airplane was descending through about 21,000 ft about 15 minutes from Charleston Executive Airport, SC, when the flight crew heard and felt a loud bang, shudder, and yaw. The autopilot was disconnected, and a noticeable yaw was felt; however, there were no anomalies noted on any flight or engine instruments. The flight crew continued and landed without further incident. During the post-flight inspection, it was discovered that the left engine cowling had entirely separated."
72,ACC2350,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter operated by Rimbun Air crashed into a wooded mountainside in Sugapa District, Intan Jaya Regency, Papua, killing all three on board. The airplane departed Nabire at 06:44, transporting building materials to Bilogai/Sugapa Airport. While en route at 9500 feet the flight crew monitored weather information provided by the pilots of two other aircraft that flew ahead of PK-OTW to Bilogai. The first aircraft (Cessna 208B) landed using runway 27 while the second aircraft (Cessna 208B) used runway 09.  At 07:15, the captain advised the first officer to use the runway 27 for landing.At 07:19, the first officer made initial contact with the Aeronautical Communication Officer (ACO) and advised that the aircraft was approaching at 9500 feet and that the estimated time of arrival atBilogai was 07:26. The ACO acknowledged the pilot report and provided current weather observation as follows ""...wind westerly 3 until 5 knots, final 09 open with broken fog and final 27 open, visibility 5 until 7 km, blue sky overhead"". The first officer acknowledged the weather information and advised the ACO they would report when the aircraft was on left downwind runway 27.This call was made at 07:25 and the ACO then advised PK-OTW to report when on final runway 27.At 07:26:12, a stall warning sounded in the cockpit and the captain asked to the first officer to check the aircraft speed. The first officer responded the aircraft speed was 65 knots.At 07:26:16, the captain asked to the first officer to advise the ACO that they were making a go around, which he did. The captain informed the crew of a Twin Otter that was following behind that they were making a go around and that they would attempt to land using runway 09.At 07:28:33, the first officer advised the captain that the aircraft was at 8200 feet at 3.2 nm outbound from Bilogai.At 07:29:25, the first officer advised the captain to fly left. Thereafter, the first officer advised the captain that the aircraft was passing 8000 feet.The first officer, reminded the captain to fly left as the aircraft flew too close to the terrain. At 07:29:49, the aircraft impacted terrain.PK-OTW was found on a ridge at elevation of 8100 feet, about 2 nm on bearing 260° from Bilogai."

Shortly after takeoff from runway 20 at Menzelinsk Airport, the pilot reported the failure of the no.1 (left) engine, stating his intention to turn back Menzelinsk Airport. The aircraft was observed flying downwind until it descended and impacted the ground. It crashed onto a concrete wall segment and a pile of logs."
76,ACC2354,"The Embraer EMB-500, N925DR, suffered a runway excursion accident on landing at Orlando International Airport, Florida, USA.According to the pilot, the airplane completed a stable RNAV/GPS 36L approach to a ""smooth"" landing at Orlando International Airport (MCO). He had lowered a wing and was using the rudder to compensate for a crosswind, and after touchdown, ""only the right brake activated,"" and the nose went to the right. He then released the brakes, ""steered back toward centerline"" but the airplane ""came aggressively"" back to its left. The pilot decided to complete the rollout under control in the grass, rather than risk over-controlling the airplane to remain on the runway because he feared the airplane would roll inverted. The airplane continued off the left side of the runway, struck a sign, dragged and substantially damaged the right wing, before it came to rest upright facing perpendicular to the landing runway.The wind reported at the time of the accident was from 090° at 12 knots, gusting to 16 knots."
77,ACC2355,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan crashed on takeoff from Juneau International Airport, Alaska. The plane sustained significant damage but the occupants were not injured.The pilot reported that, she completed a preflight inspection before taxiing from parking, making both left and right turns, to the active runway for departure. She then completed the before takeoff checks which included a flight control check and was cleared for takeoff on runway 8 from C intersection. Once on the runway, she increased engine power and the airplane began to accelerate down the centerline of the runway. Around rotational speed, the aircraft veered abruptly to the right. In an effort to correct for the veer she applied left pedal, but the pedal travel felt limited, and the airplane continued to the right toward a float pond that parallels the runway. Believing the distance to the float pond was not adequate to safely stop, she continued the takeoff, and once airborne maneuvered the airplane toward the runway for an emergency landing. Once the pilot determined that a safe landing could be made, she pulled the firewall shutoff, fuel shutoff and moved the master switch to the off position. During the emergencylanding the right main landing gear and nose wheel collapsed, and the airplane sustained damage to both wings. A postaccident examination of the nosewheel steering system, brake system and flight control system revealed no mechanical anomalies or irregularities that would have precluded normal operation."

The pilot asked the 18 skydivers to jump as quickly as possible. The passenger voluntarily remained on board. A minute later, once the drop was complete, the pilot began the descent. During this, the engine stopped. The pilot lengthened his trajectory so as not to interfere with the parachutists. He extended the flaps in landing configuration, but did not feather the propeller to avoid, according to him, a landing that took too long. On final, finding himself low on the glide path, he retracted the flaps hoping to reduce drag and thus be able to reach the runway. The aircraft lost lift and immediately sank, then touched down in a field before coming to rest in a ditch."

The pilot and three passengers were seriously injured. The aircraft sustained substantial damage.The pilot reported that during the takeoff roll from Yakutat Airport, he applied takeoff engine power and about 2 seconds later attempted to raise the tail of the airplane by applying forward elevator. He said that the tail came up slightly, but it subsequently settled back to the runway. He thought this was unusual but attributed it to an aft loaded airplane, applied additional nose down trim and departed without incident. While enroute he stated that the tail of the airplane seemed to move up and down which he attributed to turbulence. Upon arrival at Dry Bay Airport he entered a left downwind for runway 23. At an altitude of about 600 ft, he reduced engine power and extended the flaps to 10° abeam the end of the runway. He turned base leg about half a mile from the approach end of the runway and slowed the airplane to 80 mph. While turning final he noticed the airplane seemed to pitch up, so he applied full nose down pitch trim and extended the flaps an additional 10°. On short final he applied full flaps, and the airplane abruptly pitched up to about a 45° angle. He stated that he applied full nose down elevator, verified the pitch trim, and reduced the power to idle. When the airplane was about 300 ft above ground level, the airplane stalled, broke slightly to the left and entered about a 45° nose down dive. After allowing the airplane to gain airspeed, he applied full back elevator.The airplane consequently impacted forested terrain near the approach end of runway 23 at an elevation of about 18 ft, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and empennage."
103,ACC2381,"Tara Air flight 197, a DHC-6 Twin Otter 300, impacted a mountainside at 14500 feet while on a domestic flight from Pokhara to Jomsom, Nepal. All 22 occupants suffered fatal injuries.The flight was the first of five Tara Air flights from Pokhara to Jomsom that day and scheduled to depart at 06:15 hours. The flight was delayed because the Lete Pass on the route was covered up with clouds. The Twin Otter finally departed at 09:55, after two aircraft of Summit Air had departed for Jomsom. 9N-AET was supposed to take-off as the second flight but the captain seemed hesitant to commence  the flight due to a weather report from the first Summit Air flight that, the en-route weather was not favorable for VFR flights and critical around LETE and TATOPANI.The cockpit voice recording revealed that someone, either ground staff or some intimate passenger to the crew, advised the PIC strongly to conduct the flight.The aircraft took off from Pokhara from runway 04. The Tower controller instructed to ""report 5 DME northwest runway 04"". Then after departure the aircraft turned left to maintain a heading of 345 and planned to join heading 305 degree towards Ghodepani. After four minutes, flight 197 reported, ""Now on course... 6000 climbing and ETA Jomsom 32"" (0432 UTC). At 04:21 UTC flight 197 reported to Pokhara Tower as position approaching Ghodepani 12000 climbing for 12500. After 6 Seconds ATC Pokhara asked flight 197, ""confirm would like to change level and TRA 197 replied, No Ma'am we have crossed Ghodepani and like to be on. Pokhara Tower instructed, Tara 197 contact Jomsom Tower 122.5CVR recordings show that after flight 197 crossed Ghodepani, the PIC was not comfortable with the en-route weather. However, the flight was continued following the advice of the preceding Summit Air flight. At 04:26 UTC, flight 197 made the first contact with Jomsom AFS and reported its position to which Jomsom Tower conveyed the prevailing weather as ""Wind South Westerly up to 30 kts, QNH 1019, Temp 18º"". The PIC of flight 197 reconfirmed twice if the wind was maximum, up to 30 kts and currently South Westerly 25 kts. The crew was discussing about the bad weather being  encountered and the PIC himself voiced his dissatisfaction about the behavior of other pilots who conduct VFR flights in such unfavorable weather. The CVR recordings reveal that the aircraft was encountering clouds and the PIC was trying his best to remain clear of the clouds. The PIC was searching for light and brighter areas and adamantly heading towards it. The aircraft was maintaining 12000 ft and was in a climbing attitude. During the continuous attempts of crew to avoid the clouds with Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) inhibited, the aircraft struck rocky terrain at an altitude of 4050 meters AMSL at Sanusare Mountain. The cockpit voice recoerder readout showed that the aural GPWS warning, a function of TAWS, was triggered approximately 3 seconds prior to the impact. However, there was no aural warning of enhanced Forward Looking Terrain Alert (FLTA), Premature Descent Alert (PDA), and Imminent Terrain Impact (ITI) Alert/Warning function of TAWS.Further investigation of tht TAWS showed that it was configured to use GPS altitude, however no data was received by the system. This was likely caused by the misconfiguration of the RS-232 output format from the Garmin GPS receiver. As a result Corrected Barometric Altitude (CBA), computed by the Air Data Computer (ADC), was the only altitude input. In order to compute a reliable CBA, a regional barometric pressure setting must be entered into the ADC. This had not been done, so during the previous flights the CBA was off by 73 to 866 feet.Due to an overabundance of nuisance alerts, the TAWS was inhibited."
104,ACC2382,"A Cessna 208B Supervan 900 (Honeywell TPE331-12JR 850 hp engine) skydive configured airplane was substantially damaged when it crashed in a field about 1/4 mile short of runway 25 of Oceanside Municipal Airport (OCN/KOKB), California.The pilot in training was fatally injured and the pilot was seriously injured.On the day of the accident, the pilots were performing skydiving flights while the right-seated pilot was training the left-seated pilot on the operation. A flight would consist of the pilots taking a group of approximately 17 skydivers to an altitude of about 11,500 feet mean sea level (msl) to jump out and then they would land back at the airport. The flights started about 10:15 and were an average of 17 minutes in duration with about 15 minutes on the ground between each flight; the airplanes engine was operating the entire duration. The pilots completed six flights without incident and departed on the accident flight at 13:31.The right-seated pilot remembered that on the accident flight everything was normal with the departure and the unloading of the skydivers. The airplane was descending as expected with the power at idle. As the airplane turned onto final approach, about 3 miles from the approach end of runway 25, the right-seated pilot attempted to increase the power by slightly nudging the throttle forward. He noticed that the engine power did not increase as expected and moved the throttle lever further forward. The lever was still unresponsive, and he estimated the airplane was about 400 ft above ground level (agl). He aimed for an open dirt field and observed a berm in the immediate flight path. In an effort to avoid the berm, the pilot maneuvered the airplane into a right turn.ADS-B data show that the airplanes speed dropped to 92 kts as it passed through 500 ft msl. The last recorded hit was at 13:47:10 and located about 975 feet east of the accident site. At that time, the data indicated that the airplane was at 100 msl (equivalent to 60 feet above ground level) at a speed of 68 kts. Witness stated that they observed the airplane flying at a very low altitude. The airplane then pitched down in a nose-low attitude and bank to the right. The airplane impacted terrain and collided with the side of a berm.

112,ACC2390,"A CASA C-212 Aviocar 200, N497CA, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Raeford, North Carolina, USA. The pilot-in-command was not injured, and the second-in-command sustained fatal injuries during the subsequent diversion to the Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU), North Carolina. The pilot-in-command (PIC) reported that they flew two skydiving runs then descended to the Raeford West Airport (NR20), North Carolina, to pick up a third group of skydivers.The second-in-command (SIC) was flying the approach to NR20 and was ""on heading, altitude and airspeed"" until the airplane descended below the tree line and ""dropped."" Both pilots called for a go-around maneuver, which the SIC initiated; however, before the SIC could arrest the airplanes sink rate and initiate a climb, the right main landing gear (RMLG) impacted the runway surface. The PIC assumed the flight controls upon the airplane reaching 400 ft agl, then flew a low approach over NR20 to have airfield personnel verify damage. The personnel subsequently called the PIC to let him know that they recovered the fractured RMLG on the runway. The PIC directed the SIC to declare an emergency and request a diversion to RDU for landing.While enroute to RDU, the crew coordinated with air traffic control, operations, and their customer, and planned their approach and landing at RDU, with the SIC responsible for communicating with air traffic control while the PIC flew the airplane. The PIC reported that there was moderate turbulence during the flight, and that about 20 minutes into the diversion to RDU, after conducting approach and emergency briefings, the SIC became visibly upset about the hard landing. In his final transmission, the SIC acknowledged a course heading from air traffic control. The PIC described that about this time the SIC opened his side cockpit window, and ""may have gotten sick."" The PIC took over radio communications, and the SIC lowered the ramp in the back of the airplane, indicating that felt like he was going to be sick and needed air. The PIC stated that the SIC then got up from his seat, removed his headset, apologized, and departed the airplane via the aft ramp door. The PIC stated that there was a bar one could grab about 6 ft above the ramp; however, he did not witness the SIC grab the bar before exiting the airplane. The PIC then turned the airplane to the right to search for the SIC. The PIC then proceeded on course to RDU, where he performed a low-approach and then emergency landing. Upon landing, the airplane departed the right side of the runway and came to rest upright in the grass.Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the RMLG, landing gear fittings, and the airframe structure where the fittings attach."

This was the last recorded transmission from the flight.PhantomThe U.S. Marine Corps F-4B Phantom, 151458, was part of a two-ship formation that had departed the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro, California on June 4, 1971 on an overnight cross-country return flight to McChord Air Force Base (AFB), Washington. During a refueling stop at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, on the way back, 151458 was grounded for repairs to have mechanical difficulties checked out. The radar and transponder were inoperative, there as an oxygen system leak and the radar system were degraded. Meanwhile the flight leader continued back to MCAS El Toro.Maintenance personnel replaced a fuse to fix the radio, but they did not have the personnel to check the transponder. They confirmed the oxygen leak, but could not repair it. No attempt was made to restore the radar to peak performance at that time. The crew of 151458 then flew to Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) Fallon, Nevada, for further repairs.The maintenance personnel on duty at NAAS Fallon were unable to provide the appropriate repairs, so it was decided that the Phantom should continue to MCAS El Toro at low altitude.The flight departed at 17:16, climbed initially to 7500 feet, and then climbed to 15500 feet to clear mountains and some clouds. After crossing the mountains, they descended to 5500 feet and later further down to 1000 feet. Due to deteriorating visibility, they again climbed to 15500 feet northwest of Palmdale. The Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) was operating the radar in the mapping mode, but, due to the extremely degraded air-to-air detection capability, no airborne targets were seen. CollisionAt 18:11 both crew members of the Phantom jet suddenly noticed the DC-9 on their right hand side. The pilot initiated an evasive roll but a collision could not be avoided.The Phantom struck the forward fuselage of the DC-9, causing the nose section of the DC-9 the separate from the fuselage. The F-4 began to tumble violently about the lateral axis and the RIO ejected from the aircraft. He parachuted to the ground without injury. The DC-9 crashed in a wooded canyon with approximately 60° slopes"
70,ACC170,"The DC-3 wasn't able to gain height on takeoff from the 3000 feet Shelter Cove runway. The wheels left the ground twice, but the aircraft touched down again 150 feet past the runway end. The undercarriage struck a transformer and the no. 1 engine struck the roof of a sewage disposal building. The DC-3 became airborne again and arched downward over the cliffs, into the ocean and crashed 150 yds offshore. The pilot had failed to remove the rudder and elevator gust locks."
71,ACC171,"The Boeing, named ""Clipper Rising Sun"", was on a cargo flight from San Francisco via Honolulu, Guam and Manila to Saigon. While on a VOR/DME approach to Manila runway 24, the aircraft struck Mount Kamunay at an altitude of 2525 feet (770 m)."
72,ACC172,"Continental Air Lines Flight 712, a Boeing 707-320C, N47330, on a regularly scheduled flight from Hilo, Hawaii, to the Los Angeles International Airport, California, and a Cessna 150J, N61011, collided in midair. The collision occurred at an altitude of approximately 3,950 feet over Compton, California, approximately 9 miles east-southeast of the Los Angeles International Airport.There were 87 passengers, a flightcrew of three, and six cabin attendants aboard the Boeing. There were no injuries. Two persons were on board the Cessna, a pilot-instructor and a student pilot. The instructor received serious injuries and the student received minor injuries.The Cessna was destroyed by the midair collision and subsequent ground impact. The Boeing received substantial damage to the outer right-wing panel."
73,ACC173,"After the flight landed at Honolulu, and following her arrival announcement, the stewardess observed smoke midway in the cabin and immediately informed the captain. The presence of smoke was confirmed and the captain immediately stopped the aircraft and notified the control tower that he had a fire aboard. The forward passenger door was opened and the passengers were ordered to deplane. Passengers and crewmembers descended to the taxiway by means of the air stairs . Airport firefighting equipment arrived on the scene within 2 minutes of notification and the fire was brought under control within 30 seconds of their arrival . Investigation showed that the cockpit and cabin interior, including seats, rugs, wall and overhead coverings, were severely damaged by fire and excessive heat."
74,ACC174,"Alaska Airlines, Flight 1866 (AS66) was a scheduled passenger flight from Anchorage (ANC), to Seattle (SEA), with intermediate stops at Cordova (CDV), Yakutat (YAK), Juneau (JNU), and Sitka (SIT). The IFR flight departed Anchorage at 09:13 and landed at Cordova at 09:42. AS66 departed Cordova at 10:34 after a delay, part of which was attributable to difficulty in securing a cargo compartment door. The flight landed at Yakutat at 11:07. While on the ground, AS66 received an air traffic control clearance to the Juneau Airport via Jet Route 507 to the Pleasant Intersection, direct to Juneau, to maintain 9,000 feet or below until 15 miles southeast of Yakutat on course, then to climb to and maintain FL230. The flight departed Yakutat at 11:35, with 104 passengers and seven crew members on board.At 11:46, AS66 contacted the Anchorage ARTCC and reported level at FL230, 65 miles east of Yakutat. The flight was then cleared to descend at the pilot's discretion to maintain 10,000 ft so as to cross the Pleasant Intersection at 10,000 feet and was issued a clearance limit to the Howard Intersection.The clearance was acknowledged correctly by the captain and the controller provided the Juneau altimeter setting of 29.46 inches and requested AS66 to report leaving 11,000 ft. At 11:51, AS66 reported leaving FL230. Following this report, the flight's clearance limit was changed to the Pleasant Intersection. At 11:54, the controller instructed AS66 to maintain 12,000 feet. Approximately 1 minute later, the flight reported level at 12,000 feet. The changes to the flight's original clearance to the Howard Intersection were explained to AS66 by the controller as follows: ""I've got an airplane that's not following his clearance, I've got to find out where he is."" The controller was referring to N799Y, a Piper Apache which had departed Juneau at 11:44 on an IFR clearance, destination Whitehorse, Canada. On two separate occasions, AS66 acted as communications relay between the controller and N799Y. At 11:58, AS66 reported that they were at the Pleasant Intersection, entering the holding pattern, whereupon the controller recleared the flight to Howard Intersection via the Juneau localizer. In response to the controller's query as to whether the flight was ""on top"" at 12,000 feet, the captain stated that the flight was ""on instruments."" At 12:00, the controller repeated the flight's clearance to hold at Howard Intersection and issued an expected approach time of 12:10. At 12:01, AS66 reported that they were at Howard, holding 12,000 feet. Six minutes later, AS66 was queried with respect to the flight's direction of holding and its position in the holding pattern. When the controller was advised that the flight had just completed its inbound turn and was on the localizer, inbound to Howard, he cleared AS66 for a straight-in LDA approach, to cross Howard at or below 9,000 feet inbound. The captain acknowledged the clearance and reported leaving 12,000 feet. At 12:08 the captain reported ""leaving five thousand five ... four thousand five hundred,"" whereupon the controller instructed AS66 to contact Juneau Tower. Contact with the tower was established shortly thereafter when the captain reported, ""Alaska sixty-six Barlow inbound."" (Barlow Intersection is located about 10 nautical miles west of the Juneau Airport). The Juneau Tower Controller responded, ""Alaska 66, understand, ah, I didn't, ah, copy the intersection, landing runway 08, the wind 080° at 22 occasional gusts to 28, the altimeter now 29.47, time is 09 1/2, call us by Barlow"". No further communication was heard from the flight.The Boeing 727 impacted the easterly slope of a canyon in the Chilkat Range of the Tongass National Forest at the 2475-foot level. The aircraft disintegrated on impact."
75,ACC175,The aircraft descended below MDA and encountered severe turbulence and heavy rain from a thunderstorm cell. A go around was attempted but the aircraft impacted terrain.The aircraft was initially manufactured as a Lockheed PV-1 for the US Navy. After military service it was converted to an executive configuration as a Spartan Ventura and subsequently a Howard Super Ventura. In 1966 it was converted to a Howard 350 and marketed as a Howard Eldorado 700.
76,ACC176,"The DC-3 tried to return to the airport after an engine failure on climbout. A circuit was flown at low height. During a turn, the right wing struck trees, causing the aircraft to crash."
77,ACC177,One hijacker demanded to be taken to Cuba. Hijacker surrendered. Duration of the hijacking: less than 1 day. 
78,ACC178,"The An-24 operated on a flight from Simferopol to Kerch. While on final approach to Kerch the aircraft encountered an area of local fog. The crew allowed the plane to descend below the glide path until it impacted a concrete mast of a high-voltage power-line in the outskirts of Voikovo located 2,610 metres short of the runway threshold. At that time the airplane was flying 17 metres below the level of the runway.The aircraft collided with the roof of a warehouse and crashed."
79,ACC179,"The F-27 was being used for a training flight. When power was being added to takeoff after a touch-and-go, a no. 2 engine failure was simulated. The pilot continued takeoff until the instructor tried to abort the takeoff by reducing power on the no. 1 engine and applying full brakes. The aircraft overshot the runway, through a depression and ended up on its belly on the runway extension work at the end of runway 20."
80,ACC180,"At 14:58, a man traveling under the name D.B. Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727-051, Northwest Orient Airlines flight 305 from Portland International Airport (PDX) to Seattle (SEA), with the threat of a bomb. The jet was taxiing on the ground in Portland, when Cooper, who was seated in the last row of the jet, handed a note to a flight attendant, which said, ""I have a bomb in my briefcase. I will use it if necessary. I want you to sit next to me. You are being hijacked.""When the flight attendant informed the cockpit about Cooper and the note, the pilot contacted Seattle-Tacoma air traffic control and was instructed to cooperate with the hijacker. According to Cooper's demands, the jet was put into a holding pattern over Puget Sound near Seattle, while Cooper's demands for $200,000 and four parachutes (two main back chutes and two emergency chest chutes) were met. Once these were delivered, Cooper gave the captain permission to land at the flight's intended destination, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport near Seattle, Washington. The plane landed at 17:45. After a few minutes, he released the passengers in exchange for the $200,000 and the four parachutes.After refueling, careful examination of the ransom and parachutes, and negotiations regarding the flight pattern and the position of the aft stairs upon takeoff, Cooper ordered the flight crew to take the hijacked jet back into the air at 19:38. The crew was ordered to fly toward Reno, Nevada at relatively low speed of 170 knots, an altitude at or under 10,000 feet (normal cruising altitude is between 25,000 and 37,000 feet), with the landing gear down and 15 degrees of flap.Immediately upon takeoff, Cooper, who had kept one of the stewardesses with him as a hostage asked her to go back to the cockpit and stay there. Moments later in the cockpit, the crew noticed a light flash indicating that Cooper attempted to operate the rear door, and they started to notice a change of air pressure in the cabin which seemed like an ""ear popping experience"", and Cooper had lowered the aft stairs and jumped out of the plane never to be seen again. That was the last time D.B. Cooper was known to be alive. The FBI believed his descent was at 20:13 over the southwestern portion of the state of Washington. Nearly 3 1/2 hours after takeoff from Seattle, at approximately 23:00, with the aft stairs dragging on the runway, the 727 landed safely in Reno."
81,ACC181,"An Antonov 24B passenger plane, registered CCCP-46788, was destroyed in an accident 13 km from Saratov Airport (RTW), Russia. All 53 passengers and four crew members were killed.Flight SU2174 was a scheduled service from Sverdlovsk to Saratov with an en route stop at Ufa Airport (UFA). The flight left Ufa at 19:59. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Weather at Saratov was poor with low clouds and icing. While descending towards the airport, the An-24 flew through clouds for a duration of 3 minutes and 50 seconds. During this time there was an build-up of ice on the airframe up to a thickness of 15 mm. The pilot attempted counter a decreasing airspeed by adding engine power.Nevertheless control was lost and the airplane came down at a high rate of descent, striking the ground 13 km from the runway."
82,ACC182,"An Eastern Air Lines DC-9, N8943E, and a Cessna U206 Super Skywagon, N2110F, collided in flight on the final approach to runway 05, Raleigh-Durham Airport, North Carolina. Both aircraft were in communication with the Tower Control.The DC-9 landed safely with no injuries to the 23 passengers and four crewmembers. The Cessna crashed and burned on the airport. The pilot and the only passenger in the Cessna were fatally injured.As a result of the collision, the Cessna became affixed to the landing gear of the DC-9.Both aircraft were aligned along their longitudinal axis with the main landing gear of the DC-9 impaled in the trailing edges of the wings of the Cessna. The Cessna was transported in this manner for several miles before it fell free and impacted in a near-vertical attitude on the airport.PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The inadequacy of air traffic control facilities and services in flightpaths of the two aircraft and the configurations physically limited each flightcrew's ability to see and avoid the other aircraft."""
83,ACC183,"The aircraft strayed off course and collided with a hill in the Meghamalai hills, at an altitude of 5200 feet, 29 miles left off its desired track."

86,ACC186,"Air Canada flight 932 from Thunder Bay to Toronto was hijacked by a 24-year old American male passenger shortly before arrival at Toronto. He demanded to be flown to Havana, Cuba.On January 25, 1972, Canada officially asked Cuba to extradite the hijacker but Cuba didn't respond to the request.In 2001, he was arrested in New York. This was the first successful hijacking in Canada."
87,ACC187,"The C-123K transport plane departed Udon Thani RTAFB (UTH), Thailand on a so called Peppergrinder flight, which consisted of loading and dispatching mixed ordnance for use in Laos. Destination was Ban Xieng Lom Airstrip (LS-69).The airplane was loaded with 12,892 pounds of mixed ordnance, including 75 mm shells, 81 mm rounds, 222 caliber small arms ammunition and white phosphorus smoke rounds.Based on the computed crosswinds at 8,500 feet, 293's reported altitude, it was likely that 293 was to the right of his desired track enroute out of Udon Than and at a higher than normal ground speed. The pilot though supposedly well familiar with the route, was likely flying an inadequate cross-wind correction heading in and out of cloud bases. This could have placed him to the right of L-23 and, later, well to the right and beyond LS-62 since no navigational aids were available. A valley, similar to that of LS-62, is present just to the northeast of LS-62 and close to Route 46. Had the captain been to the northeast of his reported position at LS-62 and initiated a descending left turn towards LS-69, the enemy reaction over Route 46 would be immediate and violent. Large anti-aircraft guns were only 15 miles north of LS-62.The bodies of two crewmen were reported accounted for on Sept. 25, 2018."

92,ACC192,"Since its first flight on July 14, 1971, the VFW/Fokker VFW.614 prototype was engaged in several test flights. Changes were made following elevator flutter problems during test flights. For the flight on February 1, 1972 the airplane had been fitted with flutter dampers.The flight test called for an asymmetric flutter at 220 kt and 10,000 feet. This time the flutter could not be eliminated by slowing down and the crew abandoned the aircraft. Co-pilot Hans Bardill was killed when his parachute failed to open. The airplane entered a vertical dive and crashed."
93,ACC193,"The Caribou transport aircraft, carrying Lao military forces to a forward position, was making a normal landing approach when an obstruction was sighted on the runway.

A small explosion occurred and the right wing separated from the aircraft. The airplane descended in flames and crashed in the rugged jungle covered mountains west of the A Shau Valley."
111,ACC211,"The aircraft was one of a number of aircraft of this type used for the carriage of company employees and goods for Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm GmbH.A twice-weekly charter service was operated from Germany to Warton Aerodrome in the United Kingdom or, alternatively, to Blackpool civil airport.D-CASY left Munich on the morning of 29 June 1972 and landed at 09:04 hrs at Blackpool, as Customs facilities were not available at that time at Warton.During the day the aircraft remained on the ground at Blackpool and for most of the time the captain and co-pilot were with it. At 15:20 hrs six of the eight passengers to be carried on the return trip to Germany arrived at Blackpool Airport and, as it was raining, sat in the aircraft, the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of which was running. Two more passengers were expected. A flight plan was prepared for Munich via Rotterdam and filed at 15:30 hrs.The two passengers did not turn up at the appointed time and the APU was shut down while the passengers and crew waited in the aircraft. About 16:30 hrs word was received that the two extra passengers were not coming. This meant that extra fuel could be accommodated and a new flight plan direct to Munich could be prepared. It was filed by the first officer, while the captain carried out the pre-flight check. The captain then started the APU and sat in the left hand seat with the first officer in the right hand seat and, according to the passenger who survived the accident, indicated that the first officer should operate the aircraft in command under supervision.The aircraft taxied out and lined up and the surviving passenger saw the right hand wing slat extended when the first officer applied power with the brakes 'on' at the start of the take-off. The port side wing slat and the flaps were outside this passenger's field of view.During the take-off run the aircraft reached its normal rotation speed in the usual distance. However, although the aircraft was travelling fast enough, rotation did not take place and it did not become airborne. The surviving passenger saw the first officer's hand holding the throttles fully open and wondered why the aircraft did not take-off. Then he saw a gesture from the captain indicating that the take-off should be abandoned. The first officer immediately closed the throttles. Observers on the aerodrome heard the engine noise die down approximately 300 metres from the end of the runway. Subsequently brake marks were found commencing in the same area. Braking was not effective, however, and the aircraft left the end of the runway at high speed, in a level attitude with its nosewheel and main wheels in contact with the ground. Shortly before the first impact the surviving passenger noticed the captain's hand on the controls and saw aileron movement.The first collision occurred when the starboard wing tip struck and severed a post supporting one of the airfield runway approach lights. The aircraft continued, colliding with and badly distorting the double track railway lines at the edge of the airfield. The nose wheel of the landing gear was broken off by this impact and some structural damage was done to the underside of the fuselage. Almost immediately beyond the railway lines the aircraft broke through a wall and collided with a row of single storey masonry chalets in the adjacent holiday camp, demolishing six of them and setting them on fire.The wings were broken off during this impact, spilling fuel over the area, but the main part of the aircraft continued its progress, sustaining further structural damage as it did so. The forward part of the fuselage, including the flight deck, was twisted to starboard and progressively destroyed. The final impact brought the aircraft to rest against a second row of chalets which were also badly damaged. The wreckage caught fire and was destroyed. The crew of two and five of the six passengers on board were killed. The sixth passenger, although thrown clear, was seriously injured."
112,ACC212,"The aircraft lost power on one engine and crashed into the sea while attempting to return to the airport. The C-135F was on a weather reconnaissance mission associated with a nuclear test.After this accident another C-135 stationed at Hao Island also developed engine problems. It was determined that there was significant corrosion of the compressor fins and of certain pressure tap ports supplying the FCU (Fuel Control Unit) with salt particles and dust from coral and that there was a blocked bleed-valve.To prevent this, the French Air Force began to systematically wash the jet engines after exposure to a saline atmosphere."

115,ACC215,"At Gurayat, the co-pilot made the take-off and flew the flight to Tebuk. After he landed the aircraft on runway 31, it veered to the left. Application of left engine power caused the aircraft to veer to the right where it subsequently left the right side of the runway. the left wind was down as the aircraft left the runway / scraping the runway and hitting a mound of dirt off the runway. The aircraft then began a left groundloop. At about 90 deg of groundloop, the aircraft started sliding to the right causing excessive side loads on the landing gear. The landing gear began to be torn from the aircraft at this point and the aircraft continued to turn to the left. at about 170 degs of turn, the aircraft began to slide backwards with the engines being separated form the firewalls. The aircraft came to rest on a heading of 140 degs mag. There was no fire."
116,ACC216,The An-2 operated on a cargo flight from Okha to Tsimmermanovka when it entered thick fog at a height of some 35-40 metres shortly after take-off.

125,ACC225,"The Shorts Skyvan aircraft, VH-PNI, was scheduled to carry out two return charter flights from Minj to Mendi. The flight plan showed that these were to be instrument flight rules (IFR) category flights but specified that visual flight rules (VFR) procedures would be used throughout. The first flight from Minj to Mendi, which was the one on which the accident occurred, was planned with a position report abeam Mt. Hagen 9 minutes after departure and with a further 17 minute time interval between Mt. Hagen and Mendi. The planned cruising heights on these two route sectors were8,500 and 10,000 feet respectively and the tracks were 277 degrees magnetic and 245 degrees magnetic. These tracks do not take into consideration the deviations from track which are necessary to avoid the high en route terrain; the most significant being Mount Giluwe which is 14,346 feet (4373 m) in height and lies on the direct track between Mt. Hagen and Mendi. To avoid Mt. Giluwe when operating on this route at heights below the lowest safe altitude of 16,800 feet, it is necessary for aircraft to divert to the north via the Tomba Pass or to the south via the Kuta Pass. The aircraft departed from  Minj at 10:11 hours. The was offered the choice of tracking via the Tomba or the Kuta Pass and accepted the Tomba. The pilot made the necessary position reports and passed Mt. Hagen at 10,000 feet at 10:23 hours.At 10:28 hours VH-PNI reported on the Madang frequency and two minutes later Madang passed traffic information to VH-PNI and a following aircraft. The pilot of VH-PNI acknowledged this information and amended his estimated time of arrival at Mendi to 10:38 hours.At 10:35 hours Madang passed further traffic information to a number of aircraft in the area, including VH-PNI, but there was no acknowledgement from VH-PNI and the aircraft failed to arrive at Mendi.The wreckage of the aircraft was sighted from the air on the morning of 2 September on the north-eastern slope of Mt. Giluwe, at an altitude of 10,250 feet (3124 m), close to the direct track from Mt. Hagen to Mendi. It had impacted a steep, heavily timbered slope and broke up.Over the Tomba Pass there was a strato-cumulus cloud layer between 10000 and 10300 feet and unlimited visibility above."

128,ACC228,"A Soviet Air Force An-12 was approaching Tula in near minima weather. The airplane was transporting military personnel to Tula for an exercise. Ground surveillance radar had failed, so the air traffic controller was not aware of the exact position of the aircraft. On approach the airplane collided with another An-12 which was on a local training flight. There were no survivors."
129,ACC229,"The An-2 operated on a flight from Nazimovo to Yeniseisk when the engine lost power. Flying at a height of some 150 metres, the crew opted for a forced landing in a forest. The aircraft collided with trees and caught fire.The loss of engine power was due to bad quality of the fuel used."
130,ACC230,"As flight 232 approached the Alice Springs Airport, a man emerged from the toilet carrying a firearm. After landing 22 passengers were released and the hijacker demanded a light aircraft to convey him into the desert. A Cessna six seater piloted by Aero Club manager and chief flying instructor Ossie Watts taxied out. He was a accompanied by a plain clothes constable posing as navigator. The Cessna was brought within 30 feet of the F-27. When trying to get to the Cessna, the constable tried to disarm him, but failed. He was shot several times by the hijacker. Then the police opened fire on the hijacker. He was later arrested but died in hospital."
131,ACC231,"The pilot had to ditch the aircraft due to a double engine failure, caused by fuel exhaustion."
132,ACC232,"The aircraft, an EC-47, was assigned to the 361st Tactical Electronics Warfare Squadron. It operated a normal classified combat sortie under call sign Baron 56. The flight was cleared for takeoff by the tower at Nakhon Phanom, Thailand at 10:44.The co-pilot made the right seat takeoff with the aircraft commander in the left seat. Takeoff, climb out, and level off at 10,000 feet were normal and a normal, uneventful tactical mission was flown.After the mission, the aircraft proceeded to Nakhon Phanom and entered the GCA pattern at 17:00. The weather at the base was 5,000 feet scattered, 10,000 feet scattered with winds 070 degrees variable three to seven knots. The co-pilot made two uneventful GCA precision low approaches: after the second low approach the aircraft commander took control of the aircraft and requested and received permission to enter a left-closed downwind. The VFR approach was normal and the tower cleared Baron 56 to land calling the winds at 070 degrees at seven knots. According to statements from crewmembers, the touchdown was normal with perhaps a slight bounce, but the aircraft then began a gradual movement to the left, nearly departing the runway; the aircraft commander applied high power to the left engine and the aircraft then swerved sharply to the right, departing the right hand side of the runway approximately 1800 feet from the approach end at a 45 degree angle.Power was applied to go-around. The airplane crossed a ditch, and became airborne after the right main landing gear struck the west (far) side of the ditch embankment. After becoming airborne the aircraft cut a wire to the base perimeter lights and also contacted a tree along the west base perimeter. Apparently some damage was done to the Number One (left) propeller or engine since the third pilot, sitting in the flight engineer's seat noticed that the propeller disc was erratic instead of flat as it is normally. Also, other crewmembers thought the Number Two propeller or engine was not functioning properly, causing vibration, and noticeable slowing down. All crewmembers recall vibrating or knocking throughout the airframe at approximately this time; the aircraft was momentarily in a shallow left bank attempting to clear the trees and parallel the runway.Approximately three fourths of the way down the runway a shallow right turn was begun and the aircraft commander, who had noted a power loss of failure of the Number Two engine ordered the Number Two engine feathered. The aircraft was just above the trees at this point still in a shallow right turn. The navigator thinks he heard the co-pilot acknowledge the order to feather the Number Two engine. The aircraft commander then initiated the emergency procedure for engine failure by stating ""throttle - closed"" and at approximately this time the third pilot states he saw the Number one propeller slow down and a blade pitch change occur. Also crewmembers agree that at this point no sound of engine power was heard from either engine. According to the third pilot, the aircraft commander told the co-pilot ""you feathered the wrong one, you feathered Number One,"" followed shortly by ""Bring it in, bring it in."" Shortly after this, at 17:40, the aircraft impacted the trees and crashed."

135,ACC235,The AC-130A gunship was attacking some trucks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail from an altitude of 7800 feet when it was hit by 37 mm AAA. Two crewmembers parachuted to safety as fuel began to leak and an explosion tore off the left wing.
136,ACC236,"On the ground at Toronto cattle pens were installed and a cargo of 86 cattle was loaded. The Boeing 707 took off at 04:47 GMT for a flight to Edmonton. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 08:29 the flight was cleared for a straight in back-course ILS approach to runway 29. The first officer, who had just been promoted to Boeing 707 operations, was to perform the approach in blowing snow conditions. This approach was the first one after a 6-week holiday, so he lacked recent Boeing 707-experience. With the added factors of fatigue, turbulent air, and a heavily loaded aircraft the situation would have become extremely difficult. At some point late in the approach the captain took over control of the aircraft and tried to arrest the sink rate. The plane contacted poplar trees, 3137 m short of the runway. It struck the ground a glancing blow, and the tail fin struck powerlines. The aircraft finally struck a large ridge in the middle of a gravel pit. The cockpit section and a forward portion of the fuselage broke away and 86 cattle, the cargo on board, shot forward through the open front section of the fuselage and were thrown a distance of up to 100 m. A fire erupted."
137,ACC237,The aircraft was hijacked the aircraft prior to takeoff. He demanded money ($2 million) and to be taken to North Vietnam. He was arrested and appeared to have carried two toy guns.
138,ACC238,"About 15 minutes before the planned landing at Perm at an altitude of 5400 meters, the aircraft suddenly banked heavily to the right and then to the left. The An-24 spiralled down reaching a speed of almost 1000 km/h. At an altitude of 2700 m the aircraft gained some lift again and went into an upward looping. On top of it the airframe broke apart due to the high g loads. Afterwards, it fell down with a horizontal speed of 20 to 30 km/h and a vertical speed of 250 to 270 km/h. Of the 39 people aboard, about four people survived the crash as the fuselage fell on a thick layer of snow. Because of the bitter cold (- 41° C) the survivors died before rescue parties arrived. The official investigation could not establish the cause of the crash. However, clues indicating the explosion of a missile were found, e.g. dots of green paint which was not from the aircraft. The Ministry of Defence denied that there were any exercises in the area. And according to the Meteorological Service there were no launches of weather balloons in the area."

141,ACC241,"Kar-Air flight KR482 took off from Oulu Airport, Finland on a scheduled domestic service to Kuusamo. The aircraft climbed to FL70 and initially flew above the cloud layer.Before the aircraft started descent, it had been informed on the radio of the prevailing weather at Kuusamo Airport: surface wind 160°, 6 KT occasionally 10 KT, visibility 10 km, clouds 8/8 1000 feet, temperature -7°C, QNH 989 mb. After the aircraft had left its cruising level at approximately 07:24 GMT it entered icing conditions in clouds between 6000 and 5000 feet.When approaching 3000 feet, the right engine of the aircraft suddenly lost its power. The crew immediately feathered the right-hand propeller, changed to single-engine flight and turned back in the direction of Oulu while informing Kuusamo Airport ATC about the incident.Kuusamo ATC cleared the aircraft to FL 60 for the return flight to Oulu. The crew reported that the flight back to Oulu would last one hour and at the same time stated that the climbing performance of the aircraft did not permit a climb to the planned FL 60. The crew asked for FL 30 as its flight altitude and was cleared to that level by the ATC. After the engine failure the pilot-in-command had intended to climb to FL 60, where flight in clear air and without the danger of icing had been possible. Because of the icing of the aircraft, its climbing performance when flying on one engine had, however, not been sufficient for a climb to FL 60. The aircraft had been able to climb about 700 feet to reach an altitude of appr. 3700 feet but was incapable of increasing the altitude above that level. The aircraft had continued its flight in the direction of Oulu but began to continually lose altitude because of increased icing in spite of the engine power being used in the left engine exceeding the maximum continuous thrust values. The aircraft had at the end of the flight been given an estimation of the altitude of the prevailing cloudbase in the region, which was reported to be 300-500 feet. As the loss of height continued, the crew had hoped that they would get below the cloudbase and the ice formed on the aircraft would fall off or that they would be able to make a landing in the terrain choosing a suitable place for emergency landing. However, the weather in the region had been such that there was practically no clearance between the clouds and the terrain. The aircraft had lost so much height by the time it had arrived at the area of Naamanka village in Pudasjarvi parish that the first landmark the co-pilot had seen had been a trigonometric tower which the aircraft passed over by only a few metres. About three kilometres after the passing of the tower, while the pilot-in-command was trying to pick out a landing place and having difficulties to control the aircraft, it had at 08:04 GMT struck the trees and hit the ground in a swampy, sparsely wooded area 5 km north of Iinattijarvi.As a result of the impact three persons were quite badly injured while the others received only minor injuries, contusions, and bruises, and the aircraft was destroyed beyond repair."

152,ACC252,"The Invicta International Airlines Vickers Vanguard was operating on a charter flight from Bristol (BRS) to Basle Mulhouse (BSL). After entering the Basle Mulhouse terminal area, the flight was cleared to continue to the BN NDB. Weather was poor at that time: cloud base at 120 m (390 feet) and a reported runway visual range of 700 (2300 feet) and 1300 m (4250 feet). On arrival at the BN beacon the crew were cleared to descend to 2500 feet and were asked to report over the MN beacon before making a 90 degree left hand turn to finals for runway 16. At 09:56 the crew reported at 2500 feet, followed by a position report of the MN beacon at 09:57:40. When on finals over the BN beacon, the crew reported turning outbound and said they would report at the MN beacon again for another approach. When the crew reported overhead the BN beacon again, the plane was in fact overhead the airfield, flying parallel to the ILS localizer beam. After 1,5 minute the aircraft began to overshoot, correctly making an initial turn to the west. The crew, now flying well south of the field, were instructed to report back over the MN beacon. When reporting over the MN beacon again, before it would have to turn left for finals, the plane was in fact overhead the BS beacon, a beacon located to the south of runway 16. At 10:11:25 the crew reported over the BN beacon on finals and was cleared to land. In fact the plane was now flying 3 miles South of the field and 1 mile west of the extended centerline. Two miles further on Basle ATC asked the crew ""Are you sure you are over the BN?"". The captain replied ""I think I've got a spurious indication. We are on the LO... on the ILS now, sir"". Half a minute later the captain radioed ""BN is established on localizer and glide path; the ADF's all over the place in this weather."" Last radio contact was when the captain reported at 1400 feet, to which ATC replied that the flight was probably to the south of the airport. At 10:13 the plane brushed against a wooded range of hills and crashed 15 km from the airport. The aircraft disintegrated, except for the tail section, were most of the survivors were found."

At 09:15 the crew reported having reached an altitude of 9000 m. At 09:32 the controller at Chita cleared the flight to descend to 3900 m. At 09:36 the flight reported they had leveled off at 6500 m because it had been hijacked. Three minutes later the aircraft disappeared from radar.The remains of the aircraft were found in the taiga over a stretch of 10 km.It was determined that the hijacker carried a TNT explosive device weighing 5,5-6 kg. He was shot by an armed security officer on the aircraft. The hijacker almost immediately denoted the explosives. The blast breached the fuselage, causing an explosive decompression. The aircraft then broke up and crashed."
155,ACC255,"The Constellation sank back after takeoff, impacted trees and broke up. A fire erupted. The aircraft was engaged in spraying pesticides to control spruce budworm in the Quebec wilderness.It is concluded that after takeoff the flaps were inadvertently selected up. The selection was made at a lower than normal altitude and prior to obtaining the minimum flap retraction speed. A sink rate developed, which the pilot recognized and tried to correct by rotating the aircraft. When this failed to arrest the sink rate, the pilots realized the flaps were up or coming up, and then reselected the flaps to the takeoff position. By this time, however, it was too late to avoid ground contact."

175,ACC275,"The Sabreliner corporate jet had departed from Stuttgart, Germany on a flight to Toronto, Canada. Intermediate stops were planned at Shannon Airport (SNN), Ireland, Keflavik (KEF) and Frobisher Bay Airport, NU (YFB). Last contact with the flight was when the pilot radioed that he was 30 miles southeast of Frobisher Bay with about 15 minutes of fuel in the tanks. The airplane was later found to have impacted a rocky hillside some 66 miles from Frobisher Bay.It seems that a radio beacon near the Frobisher Bay Airport malfunctioned shortly after the flight had been cleared for the approach. The beacon was off the air for 49 minutes.In 1976 the Canadian government settled a lawsuit by agreeing to pay USD 1,2 million to the widow and children of one of the passengers."
176,ACC276,"A Lisunov Li-2 passenger plane, CCCP-73960, was destroyed when it crashed shortly after takeoff from Kirov Airport (KVX), Russia. All three crew members were killed; the six passengers survived.During takeoff, immediately after lifting off the runway, the no. 1 (left hand) engine started backfiring. The crew decided to return to the airport and initiated a left hand turn at an altitude of 50-60 meters. Altitude and speed could not be maintained. The airplane reached supercritical angles of attack and struck the ground 480 m past the end of the runway and 380 meters to the left of the runway at a snow-covered field near the edge of a forest."

The aircraft was seen descending for Bettles when it suddenly made a 360deg roll, with parts of the wing fluttering to the ground. The remainder spiralled down until it struck the ground. The right wing had failed near Station 183 (near the no. 3 engine) in moderate turbulence."
193,ACC293,"Lockheed L-188 Aircraft CF-PAB operated as Panarctic flight 416 and departed Calgary International Airport at 18:05 hours 29 October 1974. The aircraft was on a routine positioning flight to Edmonton with a pilot-in-command, co-pilot and flight engineer on board. The 30-minute flight was uneventful with no unserviceabilities reported by the crew. The aircraft was prepared for the continuing flight north with the loading of 20000 lb of baggage and freight and 21000 lb of jet B fuel. The aircraft pilot-in-command and flight engineer were replaced by those scheduled for the Edmonton to Rea Point leg.The pilot-in-command received a weather briefing; an IFR flight plan was filed at an initial cruising altitude of 18000 ft with Pedder Point as the alternate.The estimated time en-route was 4 hours 12 minutes. After loading 30 passengers and a fourth crew man, the loadmaster/flight attendant, the aircraft departed the Edmonton International Airport at 20:04 hours. The flight proceeded uneventfully, cruising at 18 000ft to Fort Smith where it was cleared to flight level 210. The aircraft reported over Byron Bay at 23:04 hours with an estimated time of arrival at Rea Point of 00:16. About 100 miles north of Byron Bay the aircraft was cleared to flight level 250.Radio contact was established with Rea Point about 150 miles out and a descent was started for a straight-in VOR/DME approach to runway 33. The descent was smooth except for some turbulence at 4000 ft. The aircraft levelled at 17 miles DME from Rea Point at 2000 ft for a period of 1 minute 45 seconds. The aircraft then slowly descended to about 875 ft ASL at 6 miles DME. A call was made to Rea Point advising them of the DME range on final. There was light turbulence. Fifteen hundred horsepower was selected on the engines; both the VHF navigation radios were selected to the Rea Point VOR frequency and both ADF's were selected to the Rea Point OX nondirectional beacon. Both cockpit barometric altimeters were set to 29.91 in of mercury, the latest Rea Point setting. The airspeed was indicating 150 kt which, with a 30 kt headwind component, resulted in a ground speed of 120 kt. The pre-landing check had been completed, 100 per cent flap selected and the landing gear was down. The landing lights were extended but were off, the wing leading edge lights as well as the alternate taxi lights were on. Glare had been experienced from external lights early in the descent from 10000 ft, but not thereafter. There was no pre-landing briefing conducted by the pilot-in-command.The flight engineer was able to see what appeared to be open water below with ice. The co-pilot set his radio altimeter warning to 450 ft and the pilot-in-command set his to 300 ft. When the warning light came on the co-pilot's radio altimeter, he advised the pilot-in-command. As the descent continued through the minimum descent altitude of 450 ft, the co-pilot reset his radio altimeter to 300 ft and so advised the pilot-in-command. The aircraft was still in a shallow descent. At 300 ft radio altitude the co-pilot checked the DME reading as 3 miles, saw a dark area of open water and an ice line and reported to the pilot-in-command that they seemed to be approaching an ice ridge and that they had visual contact. The pilot-in-command reset his radio altimeter to about 150 ft. Also, close to this time the pilot-in-command said he believed they were on top of a layer of cloud, repeated the statement, following which he retarded the throttles and pushed forward on the control column with sufficient force to produce perceptible negative G.The rate of descent increased rapidly to between 1700 and 2000 ft a minute. The co-pilot shouted at the pilot-in-command reporting their descent through 200 ft at 2 miles DME but there was no response. The flight engineer and the co-pilot both called through 50 ft without an observed reaction from the pilot-in-command. The co-pilot reached for the right side power levers and found the flight engineer's hands already on them. On impact, the cockpit area broke away from the remainder of the fuselage and with the cargo continued along the ice surface for 900 ft. After the cockpit came to rest, the flight engineer undid his seat belt and saw both the pilot-in-command and co-pilot in their seats. The co-pilot although injured was able to undo his seat belt and the flight engineer pulled him on to the ice before the cockpit section sank completely."

195,ACC295,"Boeing 747 D-ABYB was taking off for the last leg of the Frankfurt (FRA) - Nairobi (NBO) - Johannesburg (JNB) flight when the crew felt vibration or buffeting following lift off. The captain, suspecting wheel imbalance, raised the gear. A lack of acceleration forced the crew to lower the nose in order to maintain airspeed. The Boeing continued to descend however and contacted the ground 1120 m past the end of runway 24 and struck an elevated road 114 m further on. The aircraft broke up and caught fire before coming to rest 454 m past the initial point of impact."

217,ACC317,"On April 26, 1975, a Beechcraft A100, N700SP, was ferried from Savannah, Georgia, to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, for a corporate flight to Jackson, Mississippi. The aircraft was owned and operated by Stribling-Puckett, Inc.The flight to Hilton Head Island was completed without incident. The pilot of N700SP loaded the passenger baggage; a witness to the loading indicated that the pilot loaded the baggage carefully in the baggage compartment in the aft end of the cabin.At 21:45, the eight passengers boarded the aircraft with one passenger seated in the copilot's seat.The engines were started and the aircraft was taxied to runway 3 for takeoff. The aircraft was taxied onto the 300-foot overrun on the south end of the runway, turned 180° on the runway, and made a ""running"" takeoff.Two pilots, one inside the terminal and another outside, stated that they did not believe the engines were developing full power during the takeoff. However, there were no unusual sounds, and the engines were operating ""smoothly."" Both of these pilots believed that the takeoff run was excessively long. The aircraft used about 3,900 feet of pavement to takeoff including most of the 300-foot overrun where the takeoff began.After takeoff, the aircraft was leveled off and was flown straight and level for about 1,200 feet. There it struck the top of a tree which was 40 to 50 feet above the ground. After impact with the trees, the aircraft continued 1,200 to 1,300 feet and struck several other trees before it came to rest right side up.Fire erupted some distance behind the aircraft, but progressed toward the aircraft slowly. The slow progression of the fire allowed the three survivors time to escape through a hole in the left front side of the fuselage.Roger W. Stribling, Jr., Vice President of the Stribling-Puckett, Inc, was killed in the crash. Company President Ben Puckett suffered a broken back in the accident.The investigation showed that the aircraft would have been 436 lbs. over the maximum gross takeoff weight, with the center of gravity near the aft limit."

On August 8, 1975, the aircraft was being flown back to its home base at Greybull Airport, Wyoming. The first fuel stop was Ketchikan in Alaska, but the aircraft was not able to land there due to bad weather. Shortly after midnight on August 9, after seven hours of flight, the aircraft ran out of fuel, and the engines began to flame out. The crew attempted to reach Port Hardy Airport, British Columbia, Canada. During final approach with only one engine still running,the pilot considered he was too high to land and attempted to go-around. The aircraft struck the ground during the turn, crashed through the airport perimeter fence, crossed the rock and driftwood strewn beach, and came to rest in the ocean, approximately100 yards offshore."
225,ACC325,The crew deviated from the approach pattern and collided with a wooded hillside in clouds.

233,ACC333,Struck the side of a ridge and crashed.
234,ACC334,"Shortly after lift off, a low torque sensing switch failed precipitating an auto feather of an engine. The crew mis-handled the required feathering procedure, allowing the propeller to unfeather and windmill. Subsequently, the crew retracted the flaps. This disabled a spring tab on the rudder which was designed to give additional rudder authority for high power/low airspeed situations. The result of the windmilling propeller and the loss in rudder authority was that V(mca) increased from 101 kts to 138 kts. The airplane rolled inverted and crashed. Witness marks on the operating engine's propeller reportedly indicated that the airplane's speed when it crashed was less than 90 kts.All on board, four crew men, four students and one instructor, were killed."
235,ACC335,"The Yak-40 was operating on a domestic flight from Syktyvkar to Riga with en route stops at Vologda and Novgorod. Visibility at the Novgorod Airport (NVR) was poor due to fog, but this had not been forecast.

The Yak-40 continued and struck an apartment building and a car. A fire erupted."
236,ACC336,"DH-114 Heron registered VH-CLS was operating Connair Flight 1263 from Alice Springs to Cairns landing at Mount Isa en route.At 12:57 hours VH-CLS taxied to runway 30 at Alice Springs and was cleared for takeoff. The flight landed at Mount Isa at 15:35 hours after making a visual approach. At 16:46 hours VH-CLS taxied to runway 34 at Mount Isa, and the flight reported its departure as 16:55 hours at which time it was climbing to its planned cruising altitude of 7000 feet. As the flight progressed position reports at the appropriate reporting points were received. At 18:01 hours, VH-CLS advised that it was descending to cruise at 6000 feet. Subsequently, at 18:49 hours, VH-CLS reported as being at the Saucebottle Creek position, 146 km southwest of Cairns, at an altitude of 6000 feet. The crew indicated an ETA at the Biboohra VOR, 35 km west of Cairns, of 19:12. VH-CLS was then advised by the Cairns aerodrome/approach controller, through the Cairns Flight Service Unit (FSU), to expect an ILS approach to runway 15 at Cairns Airport.At 18:54 hours the Cairns aerodrome/approach controller issued an air traffic clearance, for transmission through the Cairns FSU, authorising VH-CLS to enter the control area via the 049 degree radial of the Biboohra VOR cruising at 6000 feet and using an altimeter setting of 1006 millibars. At about 18:55 hours, the Weather Service Office (WSO) located at Cairns Airport observed a thunderstorm, without precipitation, in the vicinity of the airport and the following 'special' aerodrome weather report was issued: Wind : 360 degrees at 6 knots, visibility : 10 km or more, thunderstorm without precipitation, 1/8 cumulo-nimbus clouds, base 3000 feet, 4/8 cumulus, base 2300 feet, 4/8 strato cumulus, base 4000 feet. This was reported to the crew.At 19:10 hours, VH-CLS reported to the Cairns aerodrome/approach controller that it was over the Biboohra VOR at 6000 feet and, following confirmation by VHCLS that its 'preferred approach' was an ILS approach, it was cleared 'on the Biboohra zero four nine radial, descend to three seven zero zero for an ILS approach runway one five, and report at Buchan Locator'. VH-CLS acknowledged this instruction and advised that the aircraft was leaving 6000 feet. At 19:17:29 hours, VH-CLS reported over the Buchan Locator turning outbound onto a heading of 330 degrees this being the standard ILS procedure; the aerodrome/approach controller cleared the aircraft for an ILS approach and instructed it to report leaving 3700 feet.At 19:20:54 hours, VH-CLS reported 'leaving three seven zero zero' implying that the aircraft had commenced the final approach segment of the ILS approach. The aerodrome/approach controller acknowledged the report and radioed: 'wind from the northwest, maximum downwind component runway one five not above six knots, runway wet, clear to land'. At 19:22:53 hours, the controller notified VH-CLS 'there's a moderately heavy shower at the field now, visibility er is reducing as the shower moves south, visibility to the south at the moment er in excess of four thousand metres, high intensity approach and runway lighting is on, advise when you would like the intensity decreased'. VH-CLS acknowledged.At 19:26:23 hours, VH-CLS reported 'going round' and the aerodrome/approach controller instructed VH-CLS to 'make missed approach on a heading of zero three five and climb to three seven zero zero'. VH-CLS turned away from the airport, descended to a low height above terrain, and completed about 270 degrees of a left hand orbit. It then entered a turn to the right during which it descended and crashed."
237,ACC337,A wheels-up landing was made in a shallow valley following fuel exhaustion. The DC-3 couldn't land at its destination due to bad weather.
238,ACC338,"The HS-125-600B jet aircraft was making a demonstration flight at Dunsfold and took-off on runway 07 at 1611 hrs with two pilots and seven passengers on board. Until the aircraft started its takeoff run no birds had been noticed which could have been a hazard to the aircraft but nevertheless, in accordance with normal bird strike precautionary procedures, the aircraft took-off with its landing lights as well as strobe and navigation lights on. At the moment the aircraft started to roll eye-witnesses saw a large flock of birds rise from the grass verge north of and towards the eastern end of the runway, apparently having been disturbed by an incoming Harrier aircraft as it taxied west along the perimeter track after landing. This track lies about 120 metres north of and parallel to the runway at this point. These birds rose into the air in a fairly dense formation and wheeled south across the runway just as the HS-125 became airborne. Other witnesses noticed a second bird flock rise from the centre of the aerodrome at the same time and fly north. The aircraft became airborne shortly before the halfway point of the runway and the commander had just reduced power from 100% to between 98 and 96% and ordered the undercarriage raised when the aircraft, then at a height of 50 to 100 feet and a speed of approximately 150 knots, met either or both of the bird flocks. The commander heard and felt a series of bangs as birds hit the aircraft. The ground witnesses describe hearing the engines at high power prior to the aircraft encountering the birds, and then hearing a succession of noises (between one to three), variously described as a muffled explosion, bang, thump, boom or whoomf followed by the cessation of the high power engine noise. At the same time balls of flame, lasting between one to three seconds, appeared at the rear of each engine. Some witnesses also saw birds falling away from the aircraft, and after the accident the remains of 11 dead birds identified as Lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) were found at a point about 1,170 metres from the commencement of the runway, i.e. a little over half way. The largest of the dead birds weighed 303g and had a wingspan of 61cm. Although neither pilot noticed any instrument indications following the bird strike the commander sensed an immediate decrease in acceleration which he considered was due to a complete loss of power on both engines; he also thought that some of the bangs were caused by the engines surging. He therefore decreased the climb attitude to maintain flying speed, partially reduced the throttle setting, and then re-opened to full throttle, but as far as he was aware there was no increase in thrust from either engine. He therefore decided to make a forced landing straight ahead and called for the undercarriage to be extended and for full flaps; simultaneously he closed the throttles and lowered the nose of the aircraft to assume the appropriate attitude for an approach to land. The aircraft touched down on the mainwheels about 180 metres before the end of the runway at a speed the commander estimated as approximately 120 knots; after lowering the nosewheel onto the ground he applied full wheel brakes which he maintained throughout the whole of the landing run. The aircraft overran the end of the runway and continued in a straight line across grass fields and through hedges before striking a ditch on the west side of the A281 road, about 285 metres beyond the end of the runway; the impact with the ditch ruptured and initiated the detachment of the entire undercarriage. The aircraft then bounced across the road at an estimated speed of 85 knots and in so doing struck and demolished a passing private Ford Cortina motor car; all six occupants of the car were killed. The aircraft continued on it underside for about 150 metres across a field on the far side of the road. Shortly before it came to a stop the commander closed the high pressure fuel cocks. Noticing light behind him the commander assumed the aircraft was on fire and ordered an immediate evacuation; the forward entry door was opened when the aircraft came to a stop and all nine occupants safely evacuated it before the fire spread."
239,ACC339,"The An-24 passenger plane, CCCP-46349, was damaged beyond repair in a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accident near Kharkov Airport (HRK). One crew member and eighteen passengers were killed; three crew members and 28 passengers survived the accident.Air traffic control reported a wrong QNH setting to the crew. The altimeter was thus programmed with incorrect parameters, causing false altitude indications. The readings of the barometric altimeter differed from the real altitude by 220 metres. On approach to Kharkov in clouds the crew ignored the warning of the ground proximity warning system and continued their descent until the aircraft hit trees, crashing into the slope of a hill.The aircraft operated on a flight from Mineralnyye Vody to Gomel via Rostov and Kharkov."
240,ACC340,Crashed.
241,ACC341,"Middle East Airlines flight 438 was a scheduled passenger service that was supposed to departed Beirut Airport, Lebanon on December 31, 1975, bound for Dubai and Muscat.The Boeing 747 that was planned to operate the flight suffered an engine problem. The flight was delayed and a Boeing 720 was prepared to replace the 747. The flight took off from Beirut Airport at 02:10 hours local time on January 1, 1976. The aircraft was en route over the Saudi desert at FL370 when radar and radio contact was lost. It was found to have crashed near Al Qaysumah, killing all 81 on board.An investigation revealed that a bomb had exploded in the forward baggage compartment."
242,ACC342,The DC-6 cargo plane crashed five minutes after take-off. The aircraft had arrived from Panama and offloaded its cargo at Cozumel. It was continuing empty to Mexico City.
243,ACC343,The Ilyushin was operating on a training flight and the crew was practicing a simulated dual engine failure with Nos. 3 and 4 engines shut down. Control was lost when the captain attempted a go-around but the No. 3 engine failed to relight. The propeller caused strong drag and the aircraft rolled and impacted with 55-60 degrees right bank.
244,ACC344,Cartwheeled when the right wing struck the runway on landing. Improper operation of the flight controls.
245,ACC345,"When close-in on a straight-in approach to runway 14, the pilot requested a 360 degree turn to lose altitude. During this turn the right wing struck the surface and was torn off. The aircraft slid along the ground on its right side, struck a rock outcrop, and came to rest 350 ft from the point of initial impact. Examination of the fuel system revealed that the fuel supply for the right engine was not transferring automatically to the no.4 cell which feeds the engine, but was spreading out by gravity to the other cells. This would be aggravated in a descent, and it is likely that the right engine flamed out during the turn due to fuel starvation.The flapper valves in no.4 and 5 tanks were not of the approved type and were not installed properly. The fuel injector nozzle in the fuel transfer system for the right engine was plugged due to the coarse mesh fuel strainers which allowed foreign particles to penetrate."
246,ACC346,Crashed in the jungle. The wreckage was found two days later.
247,ACC347,"The An-24 was approaching Saratov Airport, Russia, descended below the glide path. The aircraft touched down on the runway threshold at 2.35 g, bounced, and came down on the nose gear at 3 g.A post-impact fire erupted."
248,ACC348,"The aircraft, carrying 18930l. of fuel oil landed at Udrivik Lake. Braking action was poor so the pilot groundlooped the aircraft to prevent it from overrunning the runway. The Electra slid off sideways causing the right main gear to collapse. A fire broke out."
249,ACC349,The navaids calibration aircraft continued visual flight in instrument conditions. It struck a mountain in clouds.
250,ACC350,"Flight 60 was making a runway 11 ILS approach under conditions of low ceilings and low visibility. Descending through 4000 feet visual contact with the ground and water was acquired. The captain decided to proceed visually. The aircraft touched down fast (at 145kts) with a 3 knots tailwind component.Braking action was poor, so the captain decided to execute a go-around. Ground spoilers were retracted, flaps set at 25deg. The thrust reversers didn't disengage fully, so full takeoff thrust couldn't be obtained. Attempts to disengage the reversers failed, so ground spoilers were deployed again. The aircraft overran the wet runway, crossed a gully and a service road, struck the antenna array support structure and continued before ending up in a ravine, 700 feet past the runway."
251,ACC351,"The Avro 748 aircraft, named ""Ciudad de Corrientes"", was making a staff-transfer flight for the Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) State Enterprise. It began in Cutral-Có at 14:00 and the aircraft landed 40 minutes later on a Company landing strip in Rincón de Los Sauces. The aircraft took off at 15:55 for Cutral-Có again with 31 passengers and 3 crew.At 16:23 the crew contacted Cutral-Có and asked for information on the local state of the weather and estimated landing at 16:33. At an altitude of about 4000 feet the starboard wing failed, followed by separation of the starboard tailplane. The remainder of the plane corkscrewed and crashed."

257,ACC357,"The airplane impacted the ground in poor visibility conditions.The aircraft, a Volpar Turboliner II cargo plane, was a stretched turbine conversion of a Beechcraft G18S. The conversion was carried out in 1974."
258,ACC358,"During the certification process, the GAF N24 Nomad encountered problems with longitudinal stability at the 20° flap setting. In the opinion of the Chief Test Pilot, the stick force gradient was unacceptable at the 20° flap setting. While the longitudinal stability problem may not have affected Australian certification of the N24, it was considered important to solve the problem for a developed version of the aircraft. Accordingly, the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) made and flight tested a series of modifications to the tailplane. Before the accident flight the full-span trim tabs were fitted with 50 mm T strips.The purpose of the flight on which the accident occurred was to examine the effect of these tailplane modifications on the longitudinal stability of the aircraft in the 20 degree flap configuration required for the N24A model. It was intended that, after take-off, the aircraft would proceed to a designated flight test area where, at a safe altitude, the tests would be carried out. The aircraft was not to be flown at a speed in excess of 120 knots equivalent airspeed (EAS). At 10:51 hours the pilot of the aircraft, using his personal radio callsign GAF ONE, contacted Avalon Tower by radio and advised that he had received the current aerodrome terminal information and was taxiing. The aircraft then taxied to the east-west grass strip.At 10:58 hours Avalon Tower advised the aircraft of the local weather and that there were aircraft reports of extensive cloud and build-ups to the south-west moving in a north-easterly direction. The pilot acknowledged this information. At 11:00 hours the aircraft notified that it was ready for take-off and the controller advised that there would be a short delay, which was due to other traffic landing on the runway. At 11:00:23 hours the Nomad was cleared for take-off and an unrestricted climb.The aircraft took off into the west from the grass strip and, immediately it became airborne, the pilot applied a series of 'push-pull' control inputs to the tailplane after which the aircraft commenced its initial climb. The aircraft climbed straight ahead in a normal manner and reached a height of about 950 feet when over or just past the runway. At this point three witnesses on the ground observed the trailing edge of the aircraft's tailplane fluttering and he saw a dark object fall from the aircraft to the ground. At about this time the aerodrome controller, located in the control tower some 1250 metres south-east of the aircraft, saw it adopt a steep nose-down attitude and asked whether operations were normal. The pilot replied 'negative', and the aerodrome controller then initiated emergency procedures and the crash alarm was sounded.The aircraft then turned left onto a southerly heading while still descending, and may have maintained this heading briefly before continuing to turn left onto an easterly heading. Just prior to contact with the ground, the left wing and the nose dropped, and after impact the aircraft rotated through 120 degrees in the horizontal plane and skidded rearwards for a distance of some 70 metre before coming to rest. For the flight on which the accident occurred the aircraft carried the trade-plate registration VH-SUZ."
259,ACC359,"Beech 99 N200WP was being ferried from Bangor Airport, ME (BGR) to Bar Harbor Airport, ME (BHB) because the airport had been closed due to fog the day before. On a localizer approach, the airplane struck a 220 feet high hill, Lamoine Ridge. Visibility was 2 miles or less in fog and rain."
260,ACC360,"The DHC-3 Otter was en route between Prince Albert and Buffalo Narrows, Canada, for one hour and forty minutes when there was a loud bang from the engine, followed by a complete power loss.  Smoke was emitted into the cockpit and the pilot commenced a forced landing. Attempts to regain power were to no avail. The Otter touched down in a semi-clear area in bush country in a nose high, full flap configuration. The power loss was the result of failure of the master rod and link rods."
261,ACC361,"The EgyptAir Boeing 737 was hijacked during a domestic flight from Cairo to Luxor. The aircraft took off from Cairo at 07:15 hours local time. As the aircraft neared Luxor, three armed passengers hijacked the aircraft. They demanded to be flown to Libya, but the aircraft had to land at Luxor because the pilot told the hijacked he did not have enough fuel to reach Libya.On the ground at Luxor the hijackers demanded the release of five prisoners, detained for plotting an assassination of dissident Libyan and Yemeni political leaders.At 17:30 hours the aircraft was stormed by army commando forces and all hijackers were arrested."
262,ACC362,"The DHC-3 Otter was one of two floatplanes chartered for the Royal Commission on Electric Power Planning for Ontario.The final leg of the flight was from Winisk to Timmins/Porcupine Lake Water Aerodrome, Ontario, Canada. The pilot diverted to Moosonee after encountering deteriorating weather. The next day, at 12:30, the flight departed for the two-hour VFR-flight to Timmins.Because some of passengers had limited time to catch onwards flights from Timmins Airport, the pilot decided to take a direct route between the Moosonee and Timmins NDBs. He likely tried to navigate around areas of low clouds and high terrain. The aircraft followed the Abitibi River southward towards Abitibi Canyon Dam. The valley narrows and the terrain rises at this site of the power dam. It is believed that the pilot found the visibility decreasing rapidly in dense upslope fog in this vicinity. At 13:37 hours the aircraft struck the high tension electrical cables near the generating station and crashed to the ground."

All 176 on board both aircraft were killed.The Trident was on a scheduled flight from London-Heathrow Airport in England to Istanbul-Yesilköy Airport in Turkey, carrying 54 passengers and a crew of 9. The aircraft took off at 08:32 GMT and the flight proceeded normally. First contact with the Zagreb Area Control Centre was established on the Upper Sector frequency 134,45 MHz at 10:04 GMT. The flight was requested to report passing the Zagreb VOR at flight level 330.The aircraft flew along the centreline of airway UB5 with slight side deviation 1-2 km to the right due to wind. At 2 minutes and 50 seconds before the collision, the aircraft changed heading to 115° to head back towards the airway centreline. Airspeed was 295 Kts.The DC-9 departed Split Airport at 09:48 GMT to fly 108 West German tourists back to Cologne. Flight JP550 was issued instructions to climb to FL180.At 09:54 the flight, on passing flight level 130, switched to the Zagreb Area Control Centre lower sector east frequency of 124.6 MHz, receiving clearance to climb to FL240 and later to FL260.At 10:03 the crew switched to the frequency of the middle sector controller, responsible for safety and regulation of traffic between flight levels 250 and 310. This controller cleared to flight to FL350.The aircraft assumed a heading of 353° and a speed of 273 Kts as it passed a beam and to the west of the KOS NDB, approximately 2-3 km from the airway centreline. While heading towards the Zagreb VOR, the flight crew radioed the Upper Sector controller on frequency 134,45 MHz at 10:14:04 GMT and reported that they were climbing through FL325. The controller then requested, in Serbo-Croatian, flight JP550 to maintain their present altitude and report passing the Zagreb VOR. The controller stated that an aircraft was in front passing from left to right at FL335, while in fact BE476 was at FL330. At 10:14:38 the crew replied, also in Serbo-Croatian, that they where maintaining FL330. Three seconds later both aircraft collided. The outer five meters of the DC-9's left wing cut through the Trident's cockpit. Due to the sudden decompression, the forward part of the Trident's fuselage disintegrated. The remaining part of the fuselage struck the ground tail-first. With its left wing torn off, the DC-9 tumbled down and hit the ground right-wing first."
268,ACC368,"The aircraft was scheduled to operate an executive flight from Bhopal to Indore, India. After becoming airborne the pilot, before attaining safe speed and height, asked the co-pilot to retract the landing gear. Soon after, the pilot realised that the aircraft speed was below the minimum control speed and the aircraft was sinking. He asked the co-pilot to lower the landing gear, but before the co-pilot could select the landing gear to the down position, the aircraft mushed into the ground sustaining substantial damage.The two crew and eight passengers on board escaped unhurt.

304,ACC404,"On October 13, 1977, Lufthansa flight LH181, a Boeing 737 flying from Palma de Mallorca (PMI) to Frankfurt (FRA) with 91 passengers and crew, was hijacked by four members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, calling themselves ""Commando Martyr Halime"". The aircraft diverted to Rome for refueling. The hijackers demanded the release of eleven Red Army Faction (RAF) terrorists detained in a German prison, and US$15 million. The airplane, named ""Landshut"", continued its journey, landing in Larnaca, Bahrain and Dubai, following a series of denied landing clearances in other airports across the Arabian Peninsula. Flight 181 then flew to Salalah, in Oman, where it was denied landing, and changed course to Aden. As the main runway was blocked by vehicles and the plane was running low on fuel, the captain had no choice but to land on a sand strip nearby. In order to verify the condition of the landing gear following the rough landing, he was allowed to temporarily leave the plane. However, the captain did not immediately return to the plane after the inspection, even after numerous attempts to recall him and a threat to blow up the plane on the ground. The reasons for this prolonged absence are unclear; however, some reports indicate that the captain asked the Yemeni authorities to inhibit the continuation of the flight and to respond to the terrorists' demands. The captain returned to the airplane but he was shot in the head by one of the hijackers. The plane was refuelled and took off at 02:00 on the 17th, piloted by the co-pilot, with course towards the Somali capital of Mogadishu.On October 17, at around 03:30 UTC, the 737 landed in Mogadishu were the captain's body was thrown on the tarmac, and an ultimatum was set for the RAF prisoners to be released by 14:30 UTC. After pouring the duty free spirits over the hostages in preparation for destroying the plane, the hijackers were told that prisoners were to be released and that the transfer to Mogadishu required several more hours, they extended the deadline to the next morning, 00:30 UTC.By order of German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, a team of GSG 9 commandos assembled in Dubai. The team flew to Mogadishu in a white-painted Luftwaffe Boeing 707. After a Somali Ranger battalion had secured the airfield, the team stormed the airliner at 23:05 UTC (October 18 locally). The Somalis had distracted the hijackers for a period with the airport lights, they then lit a petrol tanker in front of the plane.In the seven minute operation, three of the four terrorists were killed; a GSG 9 member and a flight attendant were injured."

308,ACC408,"MAS flight 653 departed Penang, Malaysia at 19:21 hours on a domestic flight to Kuala Lumpur. While descending through an altitude of 4000 feet towards Kuala Lumpur, the crew reported that the plane was hijacked. The hijacker demanded to be flown to Singapore. The aircraft climbed to FL210 and proceeded to Singapore. En route to Singapore, the hijacker reportedly shot both pilots and then himself. The cockpit voice recordings indicate noises suggestive of the cockpit door being broken in, along with a reasonable amount of screaming and cursing. No noises are heard from within the cockpit to indicate any of the three occupants were conscious. The autopilot was then disconnected, possibly due to a pitch input by someone entering the cockpit and trying to control the aircraft. An investigator speculated that someone pulled back on the column, causing a pitch up, followed by an oscillation. This rapidly developed into a high amplitude phugoid oscillation that resulted in a rapid dive. The 737 crashed into a swamp and disintegrated."
309,ACC409,"The aircraft was flying a holding pattern near Salt Lake City because of problems with the electrical system. The flight crew contacted the company maintenance and were absent from the approach control frequency for about 7,5 minutes. During this time the aircraft had entered an area near hazardous terrain.

319,ACC419,"Pacific Western flight 314 was a scheduled service from Edmonton, AB (YEG) to Castlegar Airport, BC (YCG) with stops at Calgary, AB (YYC) and Cranbrook (YXC). The flight departed Calgary at 12:32 in the afternoon. The Boeing 737-200 climbed to FL200 which was reached at 12:38. Calgary ATC then reported to the Cranbrook Aeradio station that flight 314 was underway with an ETA of 13:05. At Cranbrook it was snowing with visibility reported as 3/4 of a mile. A radio equipped snow removal vehicle was sweeping the runway at the time. The Aeradio operator at Cranbrook alerted the driver of the vehicle about the incoming aircraft and gave him the ETA of 13:05; they both expected the flight would report by the ""Skookum Beacon"" on a straight-in approach to runway 16, thus giving the vehicle operator about seven minutes to get off the runway. At 12:46, while descending out of FL180, flight 314 contacted Cranbrook Aeradio. One minute later the crew were advised that snow removal was in progress. No further transmissions were received from the flight by Aeradio. The aircraft passed the Skookum beacon inbound on a straight-in instrument approach, and flew the ILS for runway 16 to touchdown. The aircraft touched down at 12:55 some 800 feet from the threshold and reverse thrust was selected. Suddenly the crew noticed a snow plough on the runway. A go-around was initiated immediately. However one of the thrust-reversers didn't fully re-stow because hydraulic power was automatically cut off at lift-off. The aircraft became airborne prior to the 2000 foot mark, and flew down the runway at a height of 50 to 70 feet, flying over the snow plough. The left engine thrust reverser doors then deployed and the crew rapidly selected the flaps up from 40deg to 15deg. The airplane climbed to 300-400 feet, banked steeply to the left, lost height and side-slipped into the ground to the left of the runway. The aircraft broke up and caught fire."

323,ACC423,"Continental Flight 603 (Los Angeles - Honolulu) received clearance to taxi to runway 06R at 09:01. At 09:22 the flight was cleared to taxi into position and hold. Takeoff clearance was given a minute later, but the crew delayed the acknowledgment, because the captain thought the clearance was given too soon after a heavy jet aircraft had made its takeoff. Acceleration was normal, but while approaching the V1 speed (156 knots) a loud ""metallic bang"" was heard, followed by a quivering. As rejected takeoff procedures were begun, the airspeed continued to increase to 159 knots. The aircraft appeared to be decelerating normally, but with 2000 feet of runway remaining, the flight crew became aware that the rate of deceleration had decreased and they believed that the aircraft would not be able to stop on the runway. The aircraft was steered to the right and departed the right corner of the runway end. About 100 feet beyond the runway, the left main gear broke through the nonload-bearing tarmac surface and failed. A fire erupted in this area as the aircraft turned to the left, coming to rest 664 feet from the runway end and 40 feet right of the extended centreline in a 11deg left wing low and 1,3deg nose-up attitude."

He was convictedfor abduction, assault, interfering with an airplane and brandishing a weapon."
328,ACC428,During initial approach to runway 32 at Köln/Bonn Airport the pilot experienced asymmetrical flaps and decided to land with flaps up. He then reduced power and silenced the gear warning horn. Shortly thereafter the engine no.3 reverser latch unlock light came on. Due to the excessive workload the crew forgot to lower the landing gear. The aircraft touched down on its belly and slid for about 1500 m on the engine pods and the aft fuselage. All four engines caught fire. Fire was extinguished within ten seconds by the airport fire department which happened to be on stand-by close to the position where the aircraft came to rest.

Takeoff clearance was given at 08:08 and the captain advanced the throttles. The initial part of the takeoff was normal, but 46 seconds after brake release, at approx. 145 knots, the pilots felt vibrations and heard a thumping sound. The no. 2 engine RPM started to decrease and the right main gear unsafe light illuminated. With 4000 feet of runway remaining, the first officer called: ""Gear is unsafe, right gear"". At a speed of 149 knots the captain rejected the takeoff. The spoilers were deployed and thrust reversers were selected. The spoilers started to retract after 2,5 seconds, upon which the captain pulled back the spoiler levers again. The spoilers retracted again four and a half seconds later. The plane crossed the end of the runway at 70 knots, traversing 457 feet of overrun before it went over a 51-ft precipice. It came to rest at the bottom of a ravine, 600 feet past the end of the runway. The fuselage was broken in two places. Although fuel tanks were ruptured, the plane did not catch fire."

At 18:07 an overflying aircraft received an ELT signal for less than two minutes.The pilot had an adverse medical cardiograph report. The possibility of incapacitation resulting in loss of control cannot be excluded."
354,ACC454,The Ilyushin 14FKM operated transportation flights for participants of the 24th Soviet Antarctic expedition.The ski-equipped IL-14 took off from the ice runway at Molodezhnaya Ice Station. At an altitude of 70-80 meters above the ground the plane suddenly descended in a left bank until it impacted a glacier.Investigation revealed that the airplane was caught in a wind shear.
355,ACC455,"Touchdown short of the runway; the left gear and wing failed.The airplane operated on a flight from Anchorage, Alaska to Lonely Dew Station in northern Alaska. En route stops were planned at Umiat and Inigok."

358,ACC458,"Fokker F-27 F-BYAH suffered aileron vibrations in flight. Modifications were made during December 1978 and January 1979. A test flight was planned on January 28. The airplane was flown by an Air Rouergue captain and co-pilot. Also present on board were a two engineers, a Fokker technician and an Air Alpes pilot. Planned flight time was fifteen minutes at an altitude of FL70 near the RZ beacon. F-BYAH took off from runway 31 at 17:15. Two orbits were flown near the RZ beacon after which the crew positioned the plane for an approach to runway 31. The aircraft struck a cloud-shrouded mountain while turning towards runway heading in preparation for an ILS approach."
359,ACC459,"Shortly after departing Kariba, Air Rhodesia Viscount ""Umniati"" was hit in the jet pipe of the inner port engine by a 9K32 Strela-2 shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missile (also known as SA-7), burst into flames and crashed out of control into a ravine in the Vuti African Purchase Area. Responsible for the shoot down were soldiers from Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe Peoples Revolution Army (ZIPRA). They were also responsible for shooting down an Air Rhodesia Viscount September 3, 1978."
360,ACC460,The Twin Otter was carrying a cargo of meat when low clouds reduced the visibility at the destination Wynyard. The pilot first diverted to Devonport but later decided to go back to King Island. He became lost and was low on fuel. A precautionary landing was made in a paddock.
361,ACC461,"At 14:28 hours Flight 4374 had levelled out at 3000 feet with the undercarriage and flaps up and was being radar vectored for an ILS approach to Auckland Airport. When visual flight conditions were encountered and the captain commenced the descent the aircraft was 9 miles from the runway threshold at an airspeed of approximately 165 knots and in a good position to carry out a normal descent and approach for a landing on runway 05. About one minute later, at 2 minutes 14 seconds prior to colliding with the sea, the aircraft's IAS had increased to 211 knots (11 knots in excess of the company's stipulatedVno) and the aircraft was passing through 1436 feet. Some 1 minute 20 seconds prior to the accident the aircraft's engine power was probably reduced to the minimum recommended setting for a descent. During the base turn the engine power was probably increased as the aircraft maintained an essentially constant altitude and airspeed during this turn. At this point the flaps were still retracted and the aircraft was not aligned with the runway. At that moment a heavy shower was obscuring the runway threshold. The first officer was not able to see any approach or runway lights. The aircraft descended until it collided with the water of Manukau Harbour, 1025 m west of the runway 05 threshold."
362,ACC462,"At 17:49 the flight took off from Los Angeles runway 24L. When the aircraft crossed the departure end of the runway, the right propeller was observedslowing to a stop. As the aircraft crossed the shoreline, popping sounds were heard from the left engine, and the aircraft stopped climbing and turned north paralleling the shoreline. As the aircraft flew north along the shoreline, it descended in a wings-level attitude, it contacted the water smoothly, bounced twice, impacted the water in a nose down attitude, and sank almost immediately near Marina del Rey, about 500 metres off shore."
363,ACC463,"The pilot-in-command diverted from the guideline and the aircraft collided with a fence and obstruction lights marking construction work while taxiing to the departure runway. The right wing tank sustained substantial damage, leading to the loss of 500 kg fuel. The Caravelle was named ""Dauphiné""."
364,ACC464,"A Yak-40 passenger plane crashed in a dacha colony close to Chardzhou Airport (CRZ), Turkmenistan. All 34 on board survived.The airplane banked steeply to the left after entering wake turbulence of Mil Mi-6 helicopter during the approach to Chardzhou. The pilot lost control and the airplane impacted terrain short of the runway."
365,ACC465,"The Tupolev 134 departed Omsk on a cargo flight to Liepaya with an en-route stop at Gorkiy (now Nizhniy Novgorod). The crew carried out an approach at night in conditions of snow and rain (visibility 900 meters). The approach was unstabilized and the plane descended too fast, below the glide slope. At a height of 180 m the crew switched off the autopilot. The plane had deviated to the right of the localizer, and the vertical speed has increased up to 8 m/s. The crew tried to establish visual contact to the ground and to banked to the left. At height of 60 m the power levers were advanced to takeoff thrust, but was already too late. At 00:57 (Moscow time) the Tu-134 clipped trees 1690 m from the runway threshold and 155 m to the right of its extended centerline at height of 10-12 m. Then it turned left, banking 45-degrees and crashed into a railway embankment at height of 2 m, disintegrated and caught fire."
366,ACC466,"The Antonov 26 crashed into a wooded hillside while on approach to Baykit (BKT), Russia. The airplane carried a cargo of oranges, 3700 kg. Some passengers were allowed to travel to Baykit by the captain of the plane.The controller had instructed the crew to carry out a missed approach because runway 24 was blocked. The flight continued on runway heading and just barely climbed until striking the hill."
367,ACC467,Damaged beyond repair after carrying out an emergency landing following engine failure.
368,ACC468,"On its way from Trivandrum to Madras, the aircraft was cleared to descent from FL270. Shortly afterwards an explosion took place in the forward lavatory, causing a complete instrument and electrical failure.The Boeing had to make a flapless landing at Madras (now Chennai). The aircraft touched down 2500 feet past the runway 25 threshold and overran. The right side of the plane caught fire."
369,ACC469,During takeoff from Sochi-the aircraft did not accelerate beyond 220 km/h for 2-3 seconds due to changing wind. The crew aborted the takeoff run 110 metres before the runway threshold although V1 had been reached. The aircraft overran the runway and collided with trees. Five out seven crew and ten out of 72 passengers were injured.
370,ACC470,The aircraft veered off the runway when one engine operated at uncontrolled high power on landing.

376,ACC476,"The Cessna 501 Citation I/SP corporate jet stalled into the ground 870 feet short of runway 19 at Akron/Canton Regional Airport, OH (CAK) while practicing touch-and-go landings. The pilot failed to use the appropriate checklist and used non-standard approach procedures which resulted in an abnormal approach profile.Pilot-owner Thurman L. Munson was killed in the accident. He was an American Major League Baseball catcher, playing for the New York Yankees."
377,ACC477,"Two Tupolev Tu-134A passenger jets were involved in a mid-air collision near Kurilovka, Soviet Union (now Ukraine). Aeroflot flight 7880, registration CCCP-65735, operated on a flight from Tashkent to Minsk via Donetsk. It departed Donetsk at 13:11 hours. There were seven crew members and 77 passengers on board, including players and coaches of the football team Pakhtakor, heading for a USSR Football Championship game in Minsk. Aeroflot flight 7628, registration CCCP-65816, operated on a flight from Chelyabinsk to Kishinev (now named Chisinau) via Voronezh. The flight departed Voronezh at 12:54. There were six crew members and 88 passengers on board.At 13:17 flight 7628 entered the Southwest sector of the Kharkiv's regional air traffic control area at an altitude of 8400 m. A request, and two subsequent requests, by the crew to climb to 9600 m were denied because of other traffic in the area.At 13:25, flight 7880 reported entering the sector at 5700 meters and requested to continue their climb to 9600 m. The controller initially cleared the flight to 7200 m and subsequently to 8400 m. Both flights were now at the same altitude, on crossing airways. The controller had calculated that the aircraft would be 3 minutes apart at that point. in fact, this was less than a minute.The supervisor of the Southwest sector noticed this and intervened. At 13:34 the supervisor instructed flight 7880 to climb to 9000 meters.A muffled response was heard by the supervisor, who assumed this was a read back from flight 7780. At 13:35:38, while in the clouds at an altitude of 8400 meters, both aircraft collided at an angle of 95°. The cockpit of CCCP-65816 collided with the right wing of CCCP-65735. After the collision, both aircraft both aircraft entered a spin and started to break up.The debris fell to the ground in a large area near the villages of Kurilovka, Nikolaevka and Elizavetovka."
378,ACC478,"At 22:38 hours a male passenger commandeered United flight 739 to return to Portland Airport, Oregon. He held a package which he claimed was a bomb. The aircraft had departed Portland at 21:00 for Los Angeles, California. An refueling stop was made at San Francisco before the flight continued back to Portland, where it landed at 01:13. He released the passengers and most of the crew after landing.About an hour later, the hijacker surrendered."
379,ACC479,"Two hours and 18 minutes after takeoff, en route from Norilsk to Krasnoyarsk, all four engines flamed out at 7,800 m due to fuel contamination. The crew attempted to reach Yeniseisk but the airport could not be reached. A forced landing was carried out on a wooded hillside. A fire erupted."
380,ACC480,"The Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar flew into the side of Daxue Mountain in poor weather. It appear the flight crew did not follow ATC instructions to follow Airway W6 to avoid bad weather, but instead followed W4."
381,ACC481,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter passenger plane was destroyed in an accident near Frobisher Bay Airport, NU (YFB), Canada. All nine on board were killed.The airplane, C-GROW, was being used for a series of flights between Frobisher (YFB) and Brevoort Island, a distance of 119 n.m. These flights were conducted under visual flight rules (VFR) with a Flight Notification filed at Frobisher.Two return flights were accomplished without incident and the aircraft was flown back to Brevoort for another round trip. On the final flight the aircraft, with the same two pilots and with seven passengers, left Brevoort at 21:57 hours local time enroute to Frobisher. The pilots contacted Frobisher Flight Service Station (FSS) at 22:31 reporting at 6000 feet altitude estimating Frobisher in 15 minutes. Upon receiving the latest weather indicating conditions below VFR limits, they requested clearance for ""Special VFR"". This clearance was granted.Another weather report was transmitted by the Frobisher FSS giving the 22:44 observation in which the ceiling had lowered to 400 ft with the visibility at 8 miles and the wind from 190 deg M at 22 knots.The pilot stated they would make a front course ILS approach to runway 36 with a landing on 18. At 22:58 they were issued a clearance for an ILS approach. They subsequently reported outbound at procedure turn altitude and at that time confirmed their planned approach for runway 36 with circling for 18. This was the last radio transmission from C-GROW.The Twin Otter was seen flying north along the runway. It then struck high ground about 1200 feet east of the runway and about 100 feet above runway level.It is quite possible that there was low cloud over the terrain east of the runway; when the aircraft had nearly completed its turn, it entered low cloud and the crew lost visual contact; the crew continued the right turn probably expecting to become visual again because they knew that good visibility existed over the runway; they did not regain contact with the ground and runway environment however and impacted the higher ground to the east of the runway."
382,ACC482,"The Pioneer carried a load of fish when it attempted to take off in crosswind conditions with wind gusting to 20 knots. The airplane swerved and nosed over, causing substantial damage."
383,ACC483,"While en route a male passenger threatened the crew with what appeared to be a pistol. He demanded to speak to the Chancellor of Germany in the presence of news agency representatives.Following 7 hours negotiation, he read a long statement by radio to authorities generally calling for a more humane world. He then released the passengers and four of the crew. After several additional hours of negotiation, he released the remaining crew and surrendered. The pistol was determined to be a plastic toy which resembled a real handgun."
384,ACC484,Ditched after engine failure just short of the South Caicos runway 11.
385,ACC485,"The plane entered thick fog en route from Comox Airport, BC (YQQ) to Port Hardy Airport, BC (YZT) and flew into a wooded hillside."
386,ACC486,Visibility at Bettles was very poor due to blowing snow and a low ceiling. DC-3 N99663 was on finals during a localiser DME approach when it struck three parked aircraft 50 feet to the right of the runway.
387,ACC487,"A hijacker told flight attendant that he had a plastic bomb in his pocket and demanded to be flown to Mexico City, Mexico. He finally agreed to land to refuel at Tijuana, Mexico, where he deplaned and was apprehended by Mexican authorities. He did not have any explosives.He claimed he had to leave the country because someone was trying to kill him."
388,ACC488,"The aircraft force landed when all engines lost power during a training flight out of Rostov Airport.Having undertaken eight instrument landing approaches at Rostov, the weather deteriorated below the minima and the crew elected to divert to Krasnodar. Whilst flying towards Krasnodar the crew lost orientation and deviated their route until the aircraft eventually ran out of fuel. The three engines lost power and the crew made an emergency landing some 43 km from the city of Tikhoretsk. The aircraft collided with trees and received significant damage, with two of the five crew members injured."
389,ACC489,"Weather in the Big Trout Lake area was poor; another aircraft in the area reported 1/8 mile visibility. The Twin Otter continued and approached the NDB tower, which it should have passed at 2000 feet amsl. The aircraft, however, struck the tower (or supporting wires) at 126 feet and crashed into the adjacent lake."
390,ACC490,"The co-pilot did not call out the low airspeed on finals, causing the plane to make a heavy landing. The plane veered off the runway and collided with trees."
391,ACC491,"The aircraft flew about 6 km beyond the destination and was observed entering Hawabanga (or Huabango) valley at a very low altitude, and at least 1500 feet below the cloud base.The height at which the aircraft entered, a safe turn around to exit the valley was beyond the performance capability of the aircraft. It struck trees in a steep banking attitude and crashed.Three persons, all of them passengers including a missionary, Brother Steven Richmond, were killed and seven others including the pilot, Phil Anderson, were injured. The pilot was mking his first solo flight on the accident route."
392,ACC492,"The Yak-40 was approaching Vologda in fog. Although visibility was reported 1500 m, the actual visibility was 700 meters, which was below airport minima.The airplane descended below decision height without having established ground contact and touched tops of trees at 20 m and crashed in a wood, cutting a swath of 204 m. It disintegrated and caught fire. Reportedly wrong information on visibility was intentionally transmitted to allow the arrival of three Yak-40 planes."
393,ACC493,"Struck high ground in bad weather while descending for an instrument approach to Ushuaia Airport, TF (USH), Argentina.Among those killed was YPF President Raúl Ondarts."
394,ACC494,"During a night time approach the airplane suddenly banked left. The crew lost control and the airplane crashed, killing all aboard.It appeared that the left flap retracted inadvertently 12 km short of the runway due to a broken cog-wheel."
395,ACC495,"After landing at El Paso, the hijacker armed with a large hunting-type knife grabbed a female flight attendant and demanded to beflown to Iran. The pilot was allowed to deplane to file a new flight plan and the 38 women and children of the 64 passengers were allowed to deplane. After about 4 hours of negotiation, during which the time the hijacker also claimed to have dynamite, thehijacker took a seat near the forward galley and was overpowered by FBI agents who had previously boarded without the hijacker'sknowledge. No explosives or weapons other than the knife were found. Sentenced to 10 years in prison under the Youth Corrections Act for Interference with a flight crewmember"
396,ACC496,"Flight PK740 departed Jeddah at 01:29 for a flight to Karachi. The aircraft was climbing to FL370 when, at 01:47, a stewardess reported a fire near the aft cabin passenger door. The crew started a descent from FL300 and were cleared to descend to 4000 feet. Following a mayday call at 02:03 nothing more was heard from the flight. The aircraft crashed in a level rocky area at an elevation of 3000 feet and burst into flames."
397,ACC497,"In 1977 Air New Zealand received permission from the Director of Civil Aviation to conduct scenic charter flights overflying Antarctica in the McMurdo area, using DC-10 airliners.Flight crews that operated these flights received a dedicated route qualification briefing which included the route that was to be flown and the operational limits regarding a.o. altitude and visibility.Nineteen days before the planned departure of flight TE901, both pilots received this briefing during which diagrams and maps were issued that depicted a track which passed to the true west of Ross Island over a sea level ice shelf. Subsequently the airline discovered that the IFR computer stored flight plan route contained the wrong destination coordinates with an error of 2° in longitude. This was changed just prior to departure of flight 901. The flight crew thus assumed they would be able to descend over a sea level ice shelf, whereas the corrected route would take the aircraft straight towards the turning point over Williams Field Air Base. This route passed direct over Mount Erebus reaching to 12450 feet AMSL. The flight crew programmed their navigation computer using these new coordinates, without having been notified of this change. The aircraft, ZK-NZP, then took off from Auckland International Airport at 19:17 (27 November). The flight progressed normally from Auckland to Antarctica and the weather was clear over Northern Victoria Land. The aircraft was on its planned track and turned over the appropriate point at Cape Hallett to proceed direct towards the next planned waypoint (the TACAN at Williams Field) near McMurdo.During this leg of the flight the weather conditions over McMurdo and Ross Island generally overcast with a ragged cloud base of 3000 feet. The direct flight from Cape Hallett to Williams Field was interrupted some 40 miles true north of McMurdo to take advantage of a hole in the cloud cover, which extended vertically to sea level and to descend the aircraft in this gap prior to its planned arrival near McMurdo. The captain bad been advised that the visibility below the cloud which was over Ross Island, was 40 miles. This descent was made despite the safety requirements to maintain a minimum sector altitude of 16000 feet until overhead McMurdo TACAN and to descend below that height only in a specified sector and in weather conditions of 20 km visibility and no snow showers, and after contacting the radar controller.When flight 901 requested a clearance for a descent from 10000 to 2000 feet on a heading of 180° Grid (i.e. towards the north) and to proceed to McMurdo VMC there was no reason for the Air Traffic Centre staff at McMurdo to question this as it was from a reported position to the true north of Ross Island and therefore the descent would take the aircraft back out over the sea level ice and the flight had confirmed it would maintain VMC inbound to McMurdo.Had the crew followed their stated intention to descend on a heading of 180° grid they would have increased their safety margin from the high ground, but without further advice to McMurdo Centre the pilot in command reversed the aircrafts descent track and from 5800 feet the descent to 2000 feet was completed on a heading of 357° grid back toward the cloud covered high ground. This inbound track had a minimum safe altitude of 16000 feet. After reaching 2000 feet the aircraft captain announced he would descend a further 500 feet to obtain a better view below the continuous cloud layer.The aircraft headed toward the cloud covered island, while the pilots were under the assumptions they were safely over a sea level ice shelf.The captain descended the aircraft a further 500 feet from the original 2000 feet but at 1500 feet and at a distance to run of 26 miles he finally became concerned and stated ""Were 26 miles north, well have to climb out of this"".The weather conditions had a high potential for a whiteout phenomenon due to the overcast conditions above the continuous snow covered slope. After the captains decision to climb the aircraft out of the area he and the co-pilot were discussing the most suitable climbout path when the ground proximity warning system sounded instructing the crew to ""Pull up"". The crew responded to the alarm without undue hesitation, the flight engineer calling off the heights of 500 and 400 feet indicated on the radio altimeter and the captain calling for ""Go-round power"". The warning 6,5 seconds before the impact was, however, too late for the crews action to make any significant effect on the aircrafts level flight path. The ground proximity warning systems alarm was delayed because the terrain closure started from above a coastal cliff 300 feet high instead of a steadily increasing slope which would have triggered the warning approximately 3 seconds earlier. The system has an approximate 6 second delay after it first senses a dangerous closure rate with the terrain below the aircraft. This is to minimise spurious alerts triggered by short steep slopes below the aircraft during normal safe flight paths. The aircraft collided with the ice slope of Mount Erebus on Ross Island at  an elevation of 1467 feet AMSL and immediately started to break up. A fire was initiated on impact and a persistent fire raged in the fuselage cabin area after that section came to rest."
398,ACC498,"Skidded off wet, icy runway on takeoff and collided with rocks bordering the runway."
399,ACC499,"The aircraft went missing while on a VFR flight along the coastline to Shishmaref. Marginal VFR to IFR weather with icing conditions below 10.000 feet. The search for the plane was called off on December 19. The wreckage was finally recovered February 10, 1980."

It veered to the right until about 50 metres from the end of the strip.The pilot released the brakes and applied power to both engines. The aircraft then deviated further to the right.The starboard wingtip struck the mud-bank at the side of the end of the strip, then the starboard prop, followed by the nose and nose-wheel. The Islander completed an abrupt 180° ground-loop and came to rest facing back up the strip, with the tail nearly level with the edge of a drop-off.One passenger sustained serious leg injuries."
2,ACC503,"The Tupolev 154A operated on a flight from Simferopol to Novosibirsk with en route stops at Sochi and Orenburg.While on approach to Orenburg Airport, the flight deviated from the glide path. The approach was continued and the airplane touched down at 3 g, 68 metres before the runway threshold. The airplane bounced and touched down again at 3.9 g, 635 metres further on, causing the fuselage to break in two."
3,ACC504,The An-24 stalled when a go-around was being executed. The aircraft crashed and fire.It carried out a flight from Kunming to Changsha via Guiyang.
4,ACC505,"An Antonov 24 passenger plane, operated by Aeroflot's Krasnoyarsk Division, was damaged beyond repair in an emergency landing accident at Krasnoyarsk Airport (KJA), Russia. Two passengers were killed. The right main landing gear was damaged during the takeoff run at Krasnoyarsk Airport (KJA) and did not retract. The aircraft burnt fuel and returned to the airport for an emergency landing on a grass/dirt strip at the airport.Some 70 metres after touchdown the right main gear broke off and later on the right central wing section was damaged, causing a fuel spill. A fire erupted. Two passengers exited the airplane on the right hand side and suffered severe burns. Both later died in a hospital."
5,ACC506,"The hijacker climbed over a fence went up the rear stairs of a Boeing 727 parked at Stockton Airport, California, and brandishing a pistol commandeered the aircraft. No passengers were aboard. Five crew and two cleaning personnel escaped. The flight engineer was taken hostage. The hijacker demanded to be allowed to issue a statement to the press and flight to Iran. After several hours of negotiation he issued a statement via the plane's radio. At one point with the pistol in his waistband he turned his back to the flight engineer who shoved the hijacker and grabbed the weapon. The flight engineer deplaned and was followed shortly by the hijacker who then surrendered.Sentenced to 15 years for air piracy and 5 years for using a firearm in a federal felony."
6,ACC507,"The aircraft was on a certification test flight to determine the horizontal distance required to land and bring the aircraft to a full stop as required by 14 CFR 25.125 when the accident occurred. The DC-9-80 touched down about 2,298 feet beyond the runway threshold. The descent rate at touchdown exceeded the aircraft's structural limitations; the empennage separated from the aircraft and fell to the runway. The aircraft came to rest about 5,634 feet beyond the landing threshold of runway 22 and was damaged substantially."
7,ACC508,"The Il-14 took off for a training flight from the Varadero Airport, Cuba, at 09:56 local time (13:56 UTC). Eighteen minutes later the flight reported level at 6500 feet.As the flightcrew began practicing stalls, the aircraft entered into a left-hand spin and the crew was unable to recover it. At 10:19 the aircraft was observed descending until it crashed offshore."
8,ACC509,Lost control after encountering clear air turbulence at FL430. The Learjet had exceeded its Mach limits when the pilots responded to the encounter. The Mach overspeed warning horn had been disconnected with an unauthorized cut-off switch.
9,ACC510,"A TAAG Angola Airlines Yak-40 passenger plane crashed near Matala in Angola, killing all 19 on board. Flight International reports that the airplane operated on a domestic flight from Jamba (JMB) to Lubango (SDD). Angolan authorities reported to ICAO that flight took off at 15:15. At 15:32 the aircraft went down when it was hit following 'actions by a foreign aircraft'. The airplane then crashed near Matala, killing all 19 on board. Since Matala is located at some 155 km east of Lubango, it seems more likely that the accident flight was routed from Lubango to Jamba.Unconfirmed reports suggest that the Yak-40 may have been shot down by a Zambian Shenyang J-6 (MiG-19) fighter plane."
10,ACC511,"En route from Leninabad (now Khudzhand) to Dushanbe the crew deviated from their course by 67 km in order to avoid thunderstorm activity. They then reported passing a beacon while they where actually 37 km from that beacon. The air traffic controller cleared the flight to descend from 6000 m to 4800 m. Then the crew has reported passing the outer marker at the prescribed height, while the plane was actually 43 km from the beacon. The controller cleared the flight down to 3600 m. The crew continued their descent and carried out the procedure right turn, following which the flight was cleared down to 2100 m. At height of 2840 m the crew noticed that their position was not correct, stopped descend and initiated a left turn. The Yak-40 entered clouds and struck the slope of a mountain, 44 km NW of the airport.It appeared that the radio compass did not work properly due to the proximity of the thunderstorm and the wind was different than forecast."
11,ACC512,"N1002G, the second DC-9-80 series prototype took off from Yuma, AZ at 18:20 for a certification test flight to demonstrate that the plane could be landed safely with a complete failure of its hydraulic systems. The crew were to fly a low approach, go around and another approach with a full stop landing. Both approaches to be flown without hydraulic pressure. The second approach was rejected at about 800 feet agl because the warning light for ""parking brakes set"" was lit. The aircraft was positioned for another approach to runway 21R. The aircraft touched down at around 175 knots just past the arresting cable, 1,831 feet beyond the landing threshold of the runway. Reverse was used before touchdown of the nosegear. The aircraft yawed and ground looped and ran off the right side of the runway. After the aircraft left the pavement, the left main gear collapsed and the right main gear and the nose gear separated from the aircraft. The aircraft came to rest on its lower fuselage about 50 feet beyond the right edge. Two 50-ton cranes then tried to lift the aircraft; one of the cranes broke and fell on top of the fuselage."

14,ACC515,"An Embraer 110P1 Bandeirante was destroyed when it crashed near Tepic, Mexico. All 13 on board were killed.The airplane operated on an air ambulance flight from Tepic, carrying ten patients and a nurse. It flew into the side of a hill some three minutes after takeoff from Tepic."
15,ACC516,"As the aircraft was taxiing for takeoff the hijacker advised the crew he had a bomb in his briefcase and demanded $100,000 and 2 parachutes. The aircraft did not take off. After several hours of negotiations, all but 5 airline employees were released. Later 3 more hostages were re leased in exchange for the 2 parachutes and then the $100,000 was delivered to the hijacker. When he was convinced he could not safely jump from the Boeing 727, he demanded a small aircraft. Upon being advised that the weather conditions for flying were poor he agreed to accept an automobile.After the automobile was brought to the aircraft, the hijacker and his two hostages deplaned. As they headed toward the automobile the hijacker was apprehended by federal officers."
16,ACC517,"The Vickers Viscount aircraft was engaged upon a passenger charter flight from Santander (SDR), Spain to Exeter (EXT). The aircraft arrived at Santander 8 minutes ahead of schedule, at 16:22.The aircraft commander recorded in the Technical Log a fuel state on shut down of 3178 litres and ordered a total fuel load of 5902 litres for the return flight, that is 454 litres less than the figure for full tanks. Whilst the aircraft commander was with the handling agents, the co-pilot supervised the refuelling. He requested a total uplift of 2720 litres and wrote the figures down, showing them to the senior of the two operators of the refuelling vehicle, which was not the one that had refuelled the aircraft on its earlier flight that day.On this previous flight, intermittent contact at the external electrical supply socket caused the aircraft's refuelling valve to open and close intermittently, interrupting the refuelling process. The refuelling was therefore completed using electrical power from the aircraft batteries.With the aircraft obtaining its electrical power from the same ground power unit as before apparently quite satisfactorily, the operators then refuelled the two sides of the aircraft one after the other, using the same hose each time. When the refueller finished pumping, its indicators recorded a total delivery of 2720 litres and the co-pilot, who had watched the operation, checked the figures and signed the delivery note accordingly. Neither pilot made a physical check of the aircraft's tanks using the dripsticks. Both fuel contents gauges had a history of defects. A recurrent problem in the port fuel gauge was recorded in the Technical Log as a deferred defect, expressed as 'port fuel contents gauge fluctuating occasionally, ie full scale deflection; rectification being carried forward until the next check'. The starboard gauge also had a defect. The aircraft commander did not draw the co-pilot's attention to this entry, who remained unaware of it. Before starting engines the pilots again set the flow meter totals at zero. The aircraft left Santander at 17:33 and was shortly afterwards cleared to its planned cruising level of Flight Level 180. The planned flight time was 2 hours and 9 minutes, with an expected fuel consumption of 3375 litres, leaving a reserve of 2527 litres. At 18:46 the aircraft passed over Nantes. The flow meters then indicated that 1964 litres had been consumed, which was exactly according to the navigation plan and the crew therefore recorded that at that moment 3320 kg (4150 litres) remained in the aircraft tanks. At approximately 19:10 whilst in the area of Dinard, the fuel contents gauges began to cause them some concern. The port gauge, with various fluctuations, occasionally fell to zero, but sometimes read full. The starboard gauge gave a reading equivalent to 500 litres and continued to fall steadily as the flight progressed. The pilots reviewed the fuel situation and although uneasy, considered that in the light of the recorded uplift and the totals on the flow meters, that they must have ample fuel on board. As the aircraft approached Guernsey the aircraft commander considered diverting there in order to take on more fuel, but after further thought decided against this action. At 19:28 when the aircraft was between Guernsey and Berry Head, it received initial descent clearance and shortly afterwards was further cleared to Flight Level 40 on a direct track for the Exeter NDB. At 19:42 the crew changed frequency to Exeter approach and started to receive radar positioning for runway 26. The cloud was given as one okta at 700 feet, 5 oktas at 1000 feet, and 7 oktas at 2500 feet, with a visibility of 13 kilometres and a surface wind of 280 degrees at 7 knots. At 19:44 the crew performed the approach checks, which included selecting flap to 20 degrees and switching on the fuel heaters. As fuel heat was selected, there was momentary flash from one of the two low pressure warning lights and after a brief discussion the crew opened the fuel crossfeed cocks, which had been closed since their pre-flight checks at Exeter.At 19:50 the aircraft was at 2000 feet QFE, just below cloud and about 8 miles from touchdown. The flap was still at 20 degrees and the undercarriage was retracted. Suddenly both low pressure fuel warning lights illuminated and in rapid succession all four engines lost power. The aircraft commander made an immediate Mayday call to Exeter and at the same time gave a warning on the passenger address system. Knowing the local terrain, the commander turned left in the best hope of finding a suitable area for a forced landing. With the flap still set at 20 degrees, the aircraft descended on a heading of approximately 190 degrees (magnetic) along a small grassy valley studded with trees, the average elevation of which was 130 feet amsl. As the aircraft crossed the boundary of the field, the port wing struck a tree, damaging the underskin and removing the mid section of the port flap. It then touched down with the nose well up, with the stall warning in operation and the control column hard back. The rear of the fuselage struck the ground first and almost simultaneously the port wing struck a tree causing a noticeable yaw to the left as the nose pitched down. Without hitting any further obstruction the aircraft came to rest after 307 metres on a heading of 074 degrees (magnetic). The crew assisted with the subsequent evacuation, which was orderly and there were no injuries. The total flight time since takeoff from Santander had been 2 hrs 20 minutes, with a fuel consumption, according to the flow meters, of 3458 litres. On examination, all fuel tanks were found to be empty."

18,ACC519,"A male passenger hijacked the flight and demanded to be taken to Cuba. The hijacker surrendered after the aircraft landed at Havana Airport, Cuba.The bomb he claimed to carry turned out to be a bar of soapHijacker surrendered. Duration of the hijacking: less than 1 day."
19,ACC520,"The aircraft was hijacked by 7 Cuban refugees, wanting to return to Cuba. Shortly after takeoff en route to Miami the hijackers poured gasoline in the aisle and on other parts of the aircraft. They then moved up and down the aisle with lighters and matches shouting ""Cuba"". The pilot made an unsuccessful attempt to convince them to return to Key West and then flew to Havana where the hijackers were taken into custody by Cuban officials. Reportedly sentenced in Cuba to 3 years."
20,ACC521,"Within minutes of takeoff a man ran up and down the aisle holding a small deodorant bottle and indicated it contained gasoline. Another held a toy with a radio antenna saying it contained a bomb. Four others held bottles of clear liquid claiming it was gasoline. They demanded flight to Cuba. Two gained access to the cockpit while the others remained in the cabin. Upon arrival at Havana, they were taken into custody by Cuban authorities.Reportedly sentenced in Cuba to 2 to 4 years"
21,ACC522,"Four hijackers, carrying containers of gasoline, hijacked the flight and demanded to be taken to Cuba. The hijackers surrendered after landing at Havana Airport, Cuba."
22,ACC523,"Just prior to landing at Atlanta a flight attendant received a two page note written by the hijacker. In the note he claimed to have a bomb in the baggage compartment and a remote control device to detonate it. He demanded $3.4 million, release of two prisoners and flight to Cuba. He held a taped up paper bag with small pull-type firecrackers and keys on the outside. He also claimed to have explosives attached to his leg. Since the aircraft was on final approach the pilot landed at Atlanta where the crew and other passengers deplaned. The local police boarded and took the hijacker into custody.The paper bag contained only balloons. His checked baggage contained a handgun and bullets but no explosives. Air piracy charges dismissed due to mental incompetence."
23,ACC524,"Flight SV163 landed at Riyadh at 16:06 GMT for a scheduled intermediate stop after a flight from Karachi. At 18:08 the aircraft took off for the final leg to Jeddah. Six minutes and 54 seconds after takeoff, while climbing to FL350, visual and aural warnings indicated smoke in the aft cargo compartment C-3. Climbing through FL220 (at 18:20), a return to Riyadh was initiated. About two minutes later smoke was noted in the aft of the cabin, and passengers were panicking. At 18:25:26 the no. 2 engine throttle was stuck. The fire had by then entered the cabin of the TriStar. Because passengers where fighting in the aisles, aft of doors L2 and R2, the captain asked everybody to remain seated (18:27:40). On final approach engine no. 2 was shut down, and the captain told the cabin crew not to evacuate. Flight SV163 landed back at Riyadh runway 01 at 18:36:24 The crew continued to a taxiway and told the tower that they were going to shut the engines down and evacuate. The engines were shut down at 18:42:18. Because no evacuation had been initiated by then, crash, fire and rescue personnel tried to open the doors. At about 19:05 they succeeded in opening door 2R. About three minutes later, the interior was seen to be engulfed in flames. None of the occupants survived the fire."
24,ACC525,"While passengers were deplaning, a small cardboard box blew up in the cargo hold which injured two cargo handlers."
25,ACC526,"A 24-year old male passenger demanded to be flown to Cuba, while holding two candles that were painted to look like dynamite. At that time the flight was 100 miles north of the destination Miami.While he was taking over the intercom to the pilots, two passengers knocked the hijacker down and overpowered him. The flight continued to Miami."
26,ACC527,"Shortly after takeoff two hijackers holding cigarette lighters and rubbing alcohol bottles stood up and shouted Cuba several times. They splashed some of the liquid which smelled like rubbing alcohol on the aircraft's interior and threatened to light the fluid unless they were flown to Cuba.The hijacker's limited the movement of the flight attendants and passengers during the flight to Havana, Cuba where the hijackers were taken into custody by Cuban authorities. Reportedly sentenced 1n Cuba to 4 and 3 years respectively."
27,ACC528,"A short time before arrival at Miami, a hijacker gave a flight attendant a note which indicated that he had placed a bomb in a public area in Tampa and it would be detonated unless the hijacker was flown to Cuba. The location and disarming instructionswere to be provided after his arrival 1n Cuba. The pilot was advised but landed the aircraft In Miami where the hijacker was taken into custody by police.He refused to provide information concerning the bomb. However no bomb was found and no explosion occurred."

The aircraft banked left and gained little altitude. It cleared the runway and came down in shallow water.The wreck is still present in Norman's Cay."
33,ACC534,"Flight SV162 experienced an explosive decompression of the cabin while climbing through 29.000 feet over international waters near the State of Qatar. The aircraft had departed Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and was enroute to Karachi, Pakistan. An emergency descent was initiated and a successful landing was made at Doha International Airport in Qatar. Two passengers were killed when they were ejected from the aircraft through a hole in the cabin floor which had resulted from the forces of explosive decompression."
34,ACC535,The Boeing 720 was approaching Quetta (UET) when the nose landing gear failed to extend. The crew decided to return to Karachi where they carried out a nose gear-up landing.
35,ACC536,"Prior to reaching Peshawar, the hijackers reported to be armed with pistols and explosives required that the aircraft divert to Kabul. Afghanistan.They claimed to belong to a group opposed to the current Pakistan government and they demanded the release of a large number of persons being held by the Pakistani government. They threatened to blow up the plane and/or shoot the passengers if their demands were not met. Over the next several days some of the passengers were released and one male passenger was shot and thrown off the aircraft. He died later. On March 8, the aircraft flew to Damascus. Syria. Several deadlines were set and passed without incident or were extended. The hijackers more than once changed their demands as to the number of persons they wanted released. Finally they settled on 55 and Pakistan agreed when the hijackers threatened to shoot the U.S. citizens aboard. On March 14 after the Libyans refused to allow them to land 54 of the 55 were flown to Syria. The hijackers then surrendered. This hijacking lastedapproximately 12 days and 10 hours, the longest to date."

43,ACC544,"While en-route to Nizhneangarsk, the weather rapidly became worse and the airport was closed. The crew elected to change course to Ust'-Barguzin. During the descent the crew intentionally misinformed ATC that they could see the ground. Shortly afterwards the aircraft struck the slope of a mountain at the east coast of the lake Baykal (Svyatoi Nos peninsula) at height of 1300 m about 30 km from the airfield.The airplane operated on a flight from Severomuysk to Ulan-Ude with an en-route stop at Nizhneangarsk."
44,ACC545,"The HS-125 corporate jet operated on a round trip from Denver, Colorado, USA to France. The return flight landed at Malaga, Spain, at Luton, Great Britain and Edinburgh, Scotland before continuing to Reykjavik, Iceland. The next leg was from Reykjavik to Narsarsuaq, Greenland.From Iceland to Greenland the crew initially employed VHF navigation followed by ""dead reckoning"". The crew estimated a fix prior to Greenland 62N 40W and was at that time receiving OZN (Prins Christians Sund). From the calculations on the flightlog and the ground features depicted on the radar scope the crew believed that they were at the planned position.When tuning in the last NDB enroute crew encountered problems in getting station identification. After what the crew thought was a station passage, descend to lower altitude was initiated. The crew now encountered navigational problems, as the NDB still could not be identified, nor could the crew get a signal making the radio compass track on the ADF. The crew initiated a climb and tried to tune in other ADF's and locators with negative result. Finally a broadcasting station was tuned in with positive result but before landing was assured the aircraft ran out of fuel and a wheels up forced landing was made on the icecap."
45,ACC546,"The aircraft was climbing following a cargo-paradrop on a forest fire when the no. 2 engine suffered a massive internal failure, resulting in fire and an explosion. Cargo was jettisoned and the 4 ""cargo kickers"" and co-pilot safely parachuted from the plane. The captain carried out an emergency belly landing on a sand bar."
46,ACC547,"While taxiing for takeoff, the no. 1 engine nearly quit two times. Shortly after lifting off, the engine failed. The DC-3 cleared cliffs in a shallow left turn. At 300-400 feet the left wing suddenly dropped, the aircraft nosed over and crashed on a mud flat."
47,ACC548,"The Fairchild C-119 airtanker was dispatched from Goleta, CA at 08:57, heading for a fire burning on the Los Padres National Forest. The airtanker arrived at the fire location and was given direction for the drop by the Incident Commander (IC). The IC instructed the airtanker pilots to keep the drop high because of steep terrain and snags. They were also instructed to drop only one-half the retardant, saving the remainder for another run. The airtanker pilots acknowledged the instructions.The airtanker pilots notified the IC that they were on final approach. As the airtanker approached the intended drop area, the IC noted from the sound of the engines that they were ""revved up."" He also heard cracking and popping sounds. When the airtanker came into his sight, the IC and another person noticed that the drop doors on the airtanker were not open and that the landing gear was retracted.The IC had worked with this airtanker and its crewmembers on several previous occasions. The IC noted that the airtanker was lower than he had expected, traveling at an air speed higher than he had observed on previous drops, and that the airtanker was in a descending attitude. The IC and one other person observed the airtanker continue past the intended drop site and then suddenly drop vertically approximately 50 to 100 feet. At that moment, the left wing tip (approximately half of the total left wing span) flexed downward, snapped off, and began cartwheeling along behind the airtanker. The airtanker began to roll left, its nose began to drop, it began to strike trees, and then it struck ground at 09:27.The captain and copilot were fatally injured upon impact. The aircraft was totally destroyed.Ground investigation confirmed the loss of the left wing prior to impact. Portions of the left wing, left flap, left inboard aileron, and approximately 20 feet of intact left wing tip were recovered between 50 to 800 feet in front of the impact point.Investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Forest Service teams showed definite pre-mishap cracks in the inner left wing aileron bell crank control assembly. The possibility of a bell crank failure could have induced aileron flutter, which in turn could have contributed to wing destruction causing the wing to separate from the airtanker."
48,ACC549,"While flying at 2000 feet, a catastrophic failure of the no. 2 cylinder caused a no. 1 engine fire. A massive fire of the outboard part of the left wing led to the separation of this part while returning to the airport."

Weather was poor (drizzle and fog) as the flight approached Zeya. Descent was continued below minimum descent altitude, even after the GPWS sounded. The crew continued the descent without visual contact with the ground until the airplane collided with treetops about 350 m from the runway threshold and 125 m right of its extended centerline. The Yak-40 crashed and caught fire."
54,ACC555,"The right hand main landing gear shear pin failed, causing the gear to collapse. Aircraft damaged beyond repair."
55,ACC556,"The pilot initiated a rolling take-off and, moments after the first officer called V1 (80 knots), the flight engineer heard a ""bang"". He then saw the no. 4 engine EGT rise to maximum. The overheat limit light went on and he called out ""engine fire"".The pilot immediately initiated an abort but asymmetrical control problems arose, which compounded the effective use of the brake system. The aircraft overran the runway incurring substantial damage. There  was no fire. Passenger injuries were sustained during the evacuation in the pitch darkness."
56,ACC557,"Air Florida Airlines, Flight 2198, a DC-10-30CF sustained an uncontained failure of its right underwing engine (No. 3) during the takeoff roll at Miami International Airport, Florida. The engine failure occurred at about 90 knots indicated airspeed. The pilot rejected the takeoff and stopped the aircraft safely.The aircraft was damaged by the release of high energy engine debris. The resultant damage caused an uncommanded retraction of the right wing outboard leading edge slat. Components of the No. 3 engine control system and fire protection system, the electrical system, and the Nos. 1 and 3 hydraulic systems were also damaged by engine debris."
57,ACC558,Three Croatians were armed with a pistol and a knife hijacked the domestic flight. They demanded to be taken to Israel.

The hijacking occurred shortly after an unscheduled stop at Dubrovnik Airport to pick up high ranking officials after an international conference.
58,ACC559,"An NLM Cityhopper Fokker F-28 Fellowship was destroyed when it crashed in an industrial area near Moerdijk, Netherlands. All 17 on board were killed.The aircraft, named ""Eindhoven"", operated flight HN431 from Rotterdam Airport, Netherlands to Eindhoven, Netherlands and Hamburg, Germany. During the weather briefing at Rotterdam Airport, 44 minutes before takeoff, the crew was told about the presence of an area with thunderstorms to the south and east of Rotterdam. At 17:04 hours local time the F-28 took off from Rotterdam Airport. About five minutes after takeoff the crew noted heavy rainfall in thunderstorms on the weather avoidance radar and received clearance to avoid this area. Course was changed to the south in order to pass between two major thunderstorm cores.At 17:12 the aircraft entered a tornado, which resulted in loads on the airframe increasing to +6.8 G and -3,2 G. The right wing was bent upwards followed by a severe downward sweep. This compromised the structural integrity of the wing, causing a large portion of the outer wing to separate in an upward and rearward motion. Control was lost and the aircraft impacted a railway bridge inverted."
59,ACC560,"While on approach to Noril'sk, the plane acquired an excessive vertical speed and descended below the glideslope. It impacted terrain in an open field about 470 m from the runway threshold and slid across the frozen ground for about 300 m. The Tu-154 had a high descent speed, maximum forward centre of gravity and slow flying speed. The high descent speed could not be countered by applying maximum elevator trim."
60,ACC561,"The DC-4 undershot the runway and struck the ground 50 feet short and 4 feet below the runway. The left main gear collapsed, causing the plane to turn 200deg."
61,ACC562,"A Beechcraft UC-12B Huron operated by the U.S. Navy crashed into a housing development area north of Pensacola Regional Airport, FL (PNS). The airplane departed Norfolk NAS Chambers, VA (NGU) on a flight to Pensacola NAS, FL (NPA). Weather was poor with light rain and limited visibility.

68,ACC569,"Reeve Aleutian Airways Flight 60, an YS-11A, with 36 passengers and 3 crewmembers onboard, made an emergency gear-up landing on the frozen Naknek River adjacent to the King Salmon Airport, Alaska, following the loss of power in both engines. The airplane was damaged substantially, and one crewmember, two passengers, and two firefighters suffered minor injuries during the evacuation, firefighting, and rescue activities."
69,ACC570,"A fire started when the No 2 engine first stage fan disk failed just after power was applied for take-off. The take-off was aborted and the aircraft stopped. All passengers and crew evacuated via forward slides, injuring two passengers.An explosion had occurred in the No 2 engine due to a failed front compressor front hub. The main fuel supply line to the No 2 engine was severed causing the fire. Metallurgical examination revealed that the hub fractured radially through the bore and rim in two locations releasing two sections. Fatigue had originated at a non-conforming circumferential groove at the rear of one tie rod hole. The surface of the groove exhibited a very rough, smeared appearance and there were numerous axial cracks."
70,ACC571,"On 14 February 1982 a 'one thousand hour' inspection was carried out on the Islander aircraft, G-BBRP, at Shobdon aerodrome , Herefordshire. After this inspection the aircraft was fuelled to capacity, in preparation for an air test for the renewal of the Certificate of Airworthiness. The air test was satisfactory in all respects and included a 5-minute check, per side, that the fuel flow and cross-feeding operation of the aircraft's wing tip tanks operated normally. At all other times during the air test, the aircraft was flown with the fuel supply selected from the main tanks. On 16 February 1982 the aircraft was delivered to Netheravon aerodrome. After arrival at Netheravon, two further flights were carried out: the first an acceptance air check, the second a parachute drop. Both these flights and the delivery flight were carried out with the fuel supply selected from the main tanks.On 18 February the aircraft was used to fly four parachute dropping flights. On this occasion, before the first flight, the pilot was reminded that the wing tip tanks were still nearly full. As it was normal practice to run the contents of the wing tip tanks down to a total of 13 1/2 US gallons per side, and to conserve this amount until it was required to be used due to low contents in the main tanks, the pilot flew all these sorties with the fuel supply selected from the wing tip tanks. By the end of the day a total of 40 minutes flying time had been completed and, as the pilot did not consider that the wing tip tank contents had been sufficiently reduced, after engine shut down he deliberately left the fuel supply selected from wing tip tanks in order to draw the attention of the succeeding pilot to further reduce the contents of the tip tanks on the next flight.The next flight occurred on 20 February when the pilot subsequently involved in the accident arrived at Netheravon aerodrome to carry out the day's flying in the Islander aircraft. As it was a weekend, there were no engineering staff present, and the pilot carried out his own pre-flight inspection of the aircraft. Whilst these checks included the normal fuel and water drain checks, the contents of the wing tip tanks were not checked by dipstick nor was he fully certain which fuel tanks were selected. The weather at the start of the day's activities was considered marginal for parachute dropping, and so the pilot first flew a weather check. During this flight, on checking the cloud base, the pilot reported encountering light airframe icing. Later in the morning the weather improved and the aircraft took off for a further weather check, this time with a load of parachutists on board. The weather proved satisfactory and a successful drop was achieved. The aircraft then landed and the engines were shut down. At this time, according to the pilot, the aircraft's main fuel gauges were indicating 35 US gallons port, 30 US gallons starboard, and the tip tanks three-quarters full by gauge reading.At 12:50 hrs the pilot restarted the engines and completed the run up checks, which included a check of the operation of the carburettor selection to hot air. As this flight was to be a drop of student parachutists, the ground running time whilst the parachutists boarded the aircraft was slightly longer than usual and, at about 12:55 hrs, the aircraft commenced the takeoff run.The pilot reported that shortly after takeoff, at a height of about 50 feet above ground level and at an airspeed of 73 knots, he detected a loss of power from the port engine. He stated that he selected the flaps up and that, as he was about to commence the shut down and propeller feathering drills for the port engine, the starboard engine lost all power. The pilot then lowered the nose of the aircraft with the intention of landing straight ahead. From a low height, with a high sink rate, he was unable to reduce the rate of descent sufficiently to prevent a heavy landing. At no time did he hear the stall warning. The aircraft slid for a total distance of 72 metres before coming to rest on its belly, with both wings severely twisted nose down near their root ends. All the occupants vacated the aircraft without injury. When it became apparent that there was no danger of fire, the pilot supervised the crash and rescue personnel in the removal of the aircraft's battery and then himself re-entered the cockpit to complete the shut down checks. During these checks, in attempting to shut off the fuel cocks, he was able to select the starboard fuel cock to OFF, but the port fuel cock jammed in an intermediate setting."
71,ACC572,"A Kuwait Airways Boeing 707 was parked at Beirut Airport, Lebanon when 12 hijackers rode up to the aircraft in an automobile. They were firing their submachine guns and boarded the airplane. They demanded the release of Musa al-Sadr, a Lebanese-Iranian philosopher and Shi'a religious leader, who disappeared while on a trip to Libya in August, 1978. They also made other demands related to the return of their leader, and called attention to his disappearance.They demanded fuel so the aircraft could be flown to Iran but Iran officials made it known that they would not allow the aircraft to land in Iran. Or at least two occasions, they fired their weapons at the control tower. Negotiations continued for about nine hours. After they reportedly were told that an international delegation would press for a United Nations Inquiry into the disappearance, they came off the plane, with eight passengers as hostages, and they surrendered. The hostages were released later."
72,ACC573,"The Air Tanzania flight bound for Dar es Salaam (DAR) was hijacked by five passengers. They forced it to land at Nairobi (NBO), Kenya. Five passengers were released and the Boeing 737 was refueled. After nearly six hours on the ground, the airplane took off at 12:15 am. The flight was refueled at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and continued to Athens, Greece. In Athens two passengers were released. The flight continued to London-Stansted (STN).The hijackers demanded to speak to exiled Tanzanian opposition politician Oscar Kambona. After he spoke to them as they demanded, the hijackers surrendered February 28.The weapons used by the hijackers to secure control of the aircraft included: two wooden imitation pistols, an imitation hand grenade, two candles wrapped up to appear like gelignite explosive sticks and three knives. But in the course of the flight possession was obtained of a hand gun (0.38 revolver), a shot gun and a rifle. These weapons belonged to passengers who had surrendered them to the captain of the plane in accordance with the regulations on the transportation of arms on aircraft."
73,ACC574,"Widerøe Flight 933 was a scheduled domestic service from Kirkenes Airport, Norway to Alta Airport, with intermediate stops at Vadsø Airport, Berlevåg Airport, Mehamn Airport and Honningsvåg Airport. The Twin Otter left Berlevåg at 13:19 hours on the third leg of the flight. The first officer reported to Mehamn Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS) at 13:22 that the aircraft was at 2,000 feet altitude over the Tanafjord and had an estimated time of arrival of 13:33. Mehamn AFIS radioed Flight 933 at 13:35, but received no answer. The aircraft failed to arrive at was declared missing.The wreckage was located two days after the accident at a depth of 45 meters in the water off Gamvik, Norway.The investigation into the cause of the accident concluded that the vertical stabilizer failed in flight in strong turbulent wind conditions.The accident occurred during a NATO military exercise, within a self-declared no-fly zone for allied military aircraft. A report in 1987 that radar had observed an unidentified aircraft which was on a collision course with the Twin Otter caused a second investigation to be started. It was concluded that the existence of other aircraft in the area could be ruled out; and that no other airborne objects could have caused the accident.The debate about the accident resurfaced in 1997 when several sources claimed there was new or overlooked evidence of the involvement of NATO aircraft. The Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) decided in 1997 to investigate the new claims and concluded that there was no evidence to support these claims.The accident was ordered investigated again in November 2002 after a retired Norwegian air traffic controller said one of the Harrier pilots, involved in a mission about the time of the accident, had requested an immediate landing because of technical problems. The report was published on 20 September 2005. It fully supported the findings of all three previous reports and found no evidence for an impact with a Harrier or any other aircraft."
74,ACC575,"During a night time takeoff from Anapa Airport the flaps were retracted prematurely. The aircraft lost height and hit tree tops 1,250 metres behind the runway threshold and 150 metres to the right of the runway's extended centre-line.The aircraft suffered damage to the left engine and the stabiliser, but the crew managed to recover the aircraft and attempted an emergency landing. The An-26 stalled on final approach and crashed in the shallow waters of Vityazevski liman between, 6 minutes and 46 seconds after take-off."
75,ACC576,"While travelling at 95 knots during takeoff from San'a International Airport, an explosion was felt, followed by shimmy and vibrations. The crew, thinking a tyre had exploded, aborted the takeoff. The explosion was in fact caused by an uncontained failure of the stage 1 HP compressor disk of the no. 2 engine. Debris punctured the fuel tank, causing a fire on the right hand side of the aircraft. The propagation of a low cycle fatigue crack on one of the embossments of the disk rim caused the disk fracture."

Just after takeoff, an explosion occurred in the wheel well area of the left engine nacelle. The crew reportedly observed that all engine instrument indications were normal with the exception that the low-pressure warning light for the fuel boost pump of the left engine was illuminated.The cabin attendant then informed the crew that fuel was leaking from the left nacelle. The crew secured the engine using the ""manual feathering"" checklist procedure and diverted the airplane to Nassau, Bahamas, for an emergency landing. Just before landing the wing flaps were positioned to the landing configuration. Upon landing, a massive and intense fire occurred in the aft section of the nacelle/wheel well area. The fire essentially destroyed the flaps and the entire aft portion of the nacelle structure, and heavily damaged the adjacent wing area and fuselage from the wing front spar to the aft pressure bulkhead."

117,ACC618,"Air Canada Flight 797, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32, was a scheduled flight from Dallas (DFW) to Montreal, Canada, with an en route stop at Toronto (YYZ).At 16:25 CDT, Flight 797 left Dallas and climbed to FL330. Except for a deviation to the south of their filed flight plan route to avoid weather, the flight progressed without incident until it entered the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center's (ARTCC) airspace.At 18:51:14 EDT, the three circuit breakers associated with the aft lavatory's flush motor and located on a panel on the cockpit wall behind the captain's seat, tripped in rapid succession. After identifying the circuit breakers, the captain immediately made one attempt to reset them; the circuit breakers would not reset. The captain assumed that the flush motor had probably seized and took no further action at this time. About 18:59:58, the captain again unsuccessfully tried to reset the three circuit breakers. He told the first officer that the circuit breaker ""Pops as I push it."" About 19:00, a passenger seated in the last row asked a flight attendant to identify a strange odor. The flight attendant thought the odor was coming from the aft lavatory. She took a CO2 fire extinguisher from the cabin wall and opened the lavatory door a few inches. She saw that a light gray smoke had filled the lavatory from the floor to the ceiling, but she saw no flames. While she was inspecting the lavatory, she inhaled some smoke and closed the door. The No.3 flight attendant then saw the No.2 flight attendant nearby and asked her to tell the flight attendant in charge of the situation. Upon being advised there was a fire, the flight attendant in charge instructed the No. 2 flight attendant to inform the captain and then to assist the No. 3 flight attendant in moving the passengers forward and in opening the eyebrow air vents over the passenger seats to direct air to the rear of the cabin. The flight attendant in charge then took the CO extinguisher and opened the lavatory door about three-quarters open. He also saw no flames, but he observed thick curls of black smoke coming out of the seams of the aft lavatory walls at the top of the wash basin behind the vanity and at the ceiling. He then proceeded ""to saturate the washroom with CO'' by spraying the paneling and the seam from which smoke was seeping and spraying the door of the trash bin. He then closed the lavatory door.At 19:02:40, the No. 2 flight attendant reached the cockpit and told the captain, ""Excuse me, there's a fire in the washroom in the back, they're just ... went back to go to put it out."" Upon being notified of the fire, the captain ordered the first officer to inspect the lavatory. The captain then donned his oxygen mask and selected the 100-percent oxygen position on his regulator. The first officer left the cockpit but did not take either smoke goggles or a portable oxygen bottle with him. (The airplane was not equipped with nor was it required to be equipped with self-contained breathing equipment or a full face smoke mask.) The first officer said that he could not get to the aft lavatory because the smoke, which had migrated over the last three to four rows of seats, was too thick. The flight attendant in charge told the first officer what he had seen when he opened the lavatory door, that he had discharged the CO2 extinguisher into the lavatory, and that he had not been able to see the source of the smoke before closing the door. He told the first officer, however, that he did not believe the fire was in the lavatory's trash container. The first officer told the flight attendant in charge that he was going forward to get smoke goggles. At 19:04:07, the first officer returned to the cockpit and told the captain that the smoke had prevented him from entering the aft lavatory and that he thought ""we'd better go down."" He did not tell the captain that the flight attendant in charge had told him that the fire was not in the trash bin. However, at 19:04:16, before the captain could respond, the flight attendant in charge came to the cockpit and told the captain that the passengers had been moved forward and that the captain didn't ""have to worry, I think its gonna be easing up."" The first officer looked back into the cabin and said that it was almost clear in the back. He told the captain, ""it's starting to clear now,"" and that he would go aft again if the captain wanted him to do so. According to the captain, the first officer's smoke goggles were stored in a bin on the right side of the cockpit and were not easily accessible to the first officer while he was not in his seat. Since the first officer needed the goggles and since there was a hurry, the captain gave him his goggles and, at 19:04:46, directed him to go aft.Two minutes later, while the first officer was out of the cockpit, the flight attendant in charge told the captain again that the smoke was clearing. The captain believed the fire was in the lavatory trash bin and decided not to descend at this time because he ""expected it (the fire) to be put out."" About 19:05:35, while the first officer was still aft to inspect the aft lavatory, the airplane experienced a series of electrical malfunctions. The master caution light illuminated, indicating that the airplane's left a.c. and d.c. electrical systems had lost power.In the meanwhile, the first officer proceeded to the aft lavatory and put on the smoke goggles. The lavatory door felt hot to the touch, so he decided not to open it and instructed the cabin crew to leave it closed. At that time, he noticed a flight attendant signaling him to hurry back to the cockpit. The first officer returned to the cockpit and got into his seat, and at 19:07:11, he told the captain, ""I don't like what's happening, I think we better go down, okay?"" Then the master warning light illuminated and the annunciator lights indicated that the emergency a.c. and d.c. electrical buses had lost power. The captain's and first officer's attitude directional indicators tumbled. The captain ordered the first officer to activate the emergency power switch, thereby directing battery power to the emergency a.c. and d.c. buses. The attitude directional indicators' gyros began erecting, however, because of the loss of a.c. power, the stabilizer trim was inoperative and remained so during the rest of the flight. At 19:08:12, Flight 797 called the radar high sector controller at Indianapolis Center: ""Mayday, Mayday, Mayday."" The Louisville radar high sector controller acknowledged the call, and at 19:08:47, the flight told the controller that it had a fire and was going down. The controller told the flight that it was 25 nautical miles from Cincinnati and asked ""can you possibly make Cincinnati."" The flight answered that it could make Cincinnati and then requested clearance; it was then cleared to descend to 5,000 feet. At 19:09:05, Flight 797 reported that it was leaving FL330. The flight then told the controller that it needed to be vectored toward Cincinnati, that it was declaring an emergency, and that it had changed its transponder code to 7700 -- the emergency code. However, the transponder was inoperative due to the power loss.The Louisville radar high sector controller directed the flight to turn to 060 degrees and told it that the Greater Cincinnati Airport was at ""twelve o'clock at twenty miles."" The Indianapolis Center's Lexington low altitude D (LEX-D) controller then called the approach controller at the Cincinnati Airport's Terminal Radar Control (TRACON) facility to alert him of an impending handoff in his southwest sector and later told the Cincinnati approach controller that he had ""an emergency for you, Air Canada seven nine seven."" The approach controller replied, ""Zero six six two, thirty-five thousand."" Zero six six two was the code assigned to Continental 383, a westbound flight at FL350. At 19:09:33, the LEX-D controller answered, ""Yeah, thirty-three right now, he's twenty-five southwest."" The approach controller replied, ""Radar contact, okay."" However, when the approach controller accepted the handoff of Flight 797, he had mistaken the radar beacon target of Continental Flight 383 as that of Flight 797. Shortly after he had accepted the handoff, the approach controller had notified the Cincinnati Airport tower local controller that he intended to land an Air Canada jet with an on board fire on runway 36. The tower's local controller alerted the airport fire station, and crash-fire-rescue (CFR) vehicles were dispatched and positioned for an emergency landing. The firefighters had also been advised that the airplane had electrical problems, that smoke was coming from the aft lavatory, and that there was smoke or fire in the rear of the airplane. At 19:10:01, almost coincident with the end of his message to the local controller, the LEX-D controller informed the approach controller of Flight 797's assigned 060° heading. At 19:10:25, Flight 797 contacted the Cincinnati approach controller, declared an emergency, and said that it was descending. The approach controller acknowledged and told the flight to plan for a runway 36 instrument landing system (ILS) approach and requested the flight to turn right to 090 degrees. He then realized the target he was observing was not responding and attempted unsuccessfully to assign a discrete transponder code to it in order to track it better. Thereafter, at 19:10:48, Flight 797 reported that it had a fire in its aft lavatory and that the cabin was filling with smoke. The controller asked the flight to ""say the type airplane, number of people on board, and amount of fuel (on board)."" The first officer answered that he would supply this data later because ""I don't have time now."" At 19:12:40, the approach controller called the Evansville/Nabb D controller on the landline to request assistance. Almost simultaneous with the call, he also observed an eastbound primary target and began to monitor it. At 19:12:44, the flight requested the cloud ceiling at the airport and the controller responded that the ceiling was ""two thousand five hundred scattered, measure(d) eight thousand feet overcast, visibility one two (12) miles with light rain."" The controller then decided that the eastbound target was Flight 797, and at 19:12:54, he requested the flight to ""say altitude."" Based on the target's position -- about 3 nmi east of runway 36's extended centerline and about 8 nmi south of its threshold -- and its reported altitude of 8,000 feet, that it was too high and too fast to land on runway 36. He decided to use runway 27L for landing, and used the primary target to monitor the flight and vector it toward the airport. At 19:13:38, after Flight 797 was unable to tell him its heading because its heading instruments were inoperative, the approach controller asked the flight to turn left. The controller said that this was an identification turn and that it was also designed to place the airplane closer to the airport. He then told the flight that this was a ""no gyro"" radar approach for runway two seven left ... If and cleared it to descend to 3,500 feet. He then told the flight that it was 12 nmi southeast of the Cincinnati Airport, cleared it to land on runway 27L, and informed it that the surface wind was 220 degrees at 4 knots. He informed the tower of the change of landing runways and the tower directed the fire department to position its vehicles along runway 27L. At 19:15:11, Flight 797 reported that it was level at 2,500 feet."" The approach controller vectored the flight to runway 27L, and at 19:15:58, told it that it was 12 nmi from the airport. The flight descended to 2,000 feet, and the controller continued to supply range calls.When the captain sighted the runway, he extended the landing gear. Since the horizontal stabilizer was inoperative, the captain extended the flaps and slats incrementally through the 0, 5, 15, 25, and 40-degree positions. He allowed his indicated airspeed to stabilize at each flap position as he slowed to approach speed. He flew the final approach at 140 KIAS and completed the landing. After touchdown, he made a maximum effort stop using extended spoilers and full brakes. Because of the loss of the left and right a.c. buses, the antiskid system was inoperative and the four main wheel tires blew out. The airplane was stopped just short of the intersection of taxiway J. After the captain completed the emergency engine shutdown checklist, both he and the first officer attempted to go back into the cabin and assist in the passenger evacuation, but were driven back by the smoke and heat. Thereafter, they exited the airplane through their respective cockpit sliding windows. After the airplane stopped, the left (L-1) and right (R-1) forward cabin doors, the left forward (L-2) overwing exit, and the right forward (R-2) and aft (R-3) overwing exits were opened, and the slides at the L-1 and R-1 doors were deployed and inflated. The 3 cabin attendants and 18 passengers used these 5 exits to evacuate the airplane. After the 18 passengers and 5 crewmembers left the airplane, the cabin interior burst into flames. Twenty-three passengers perished in the fire. Neither the passengers, crew, nor witnesses outside of the airplane saw flames inside the cabin before the survivors left the plane. The fuselage and passenger cabin were gutted before airport fire personnel could extinguish the fire."
118,ACC619,"During a cruise climb, the aircrew noted an unusual vibration; however, attempts to isolate the vibration were unsuccessful. While climbing from FL190 to FL250, the flight engineer went aft to observe the engines & props, but noted nothing unusual. A flight attendant went forward to advise the captain that nothing was observed, when the vibration increased in intensity. As she left the cockpit, she peered out the right window and saw the no. 4 prop separate and strike the aircraft. This caused major damage to the lower fuselage and resulted in decompression of the cabin. The flight controls became jammed and the engines would not respond to throttle movement. The autopilot was used for minimal control and the flight crew were able to divert to Anchorage, AK. They were able to climb and descend by retracting and extending the landing gear with the no. 2 eng shut down. The aircraft was landed safety and the engines were shut down to decelerate. The exact cause of the prop separation was not determined since it fell in the ocean during the occurrence."
119,ACC620,"After intercepting the glide slope at 3000 feet (the aircraft was flying VFR, but the crew used the ILS as a reference), the pilot called for 2250rpm and gear extension. While descending through 2000 feet he noticed the aircraft slowing down and descending below the glide slope. Power was increased, but the engines didn't respond.At 800 feet over the Outer Marker, all 4 engines failed simultaneously. The DC-4 freighter belly landed in a cane field, 6120 feet short of the runway, and 5820 feet right of the extended centreline."
120,ACC621,"The Ilyushin Il-62M, operated by the North Korean airline Chosonminhang was flying construction cargo and several workers to Guinea, ahead of the 1984 Organization of African Unity summit.The aircraft departed from Pyongyang-Sunan Aiport, North Korea and made en route stops at Kabul, Afghanistan; and Cairo, Egypt.The aircraft crashed on the last leg of the flight and came down in the Fouta Djallon Mountains."
121,ACC622,"The An-12, carrying construction materials, carbide and barbed wires to Kabul, was struck by ground fire on departure. The aircraft crashed."
122,ACC623,"Shortly after takeoff from Miami, FL, a man approached a flight attendant, displayed a plastic bottle containing a liquid which smelled like gasoline, and went into the lavatory in the rear of the aircraft. A second man then went to the forward galley area and displayed a pear-shaped object wrapped in a cloth with a protruding wick. Speaking in Spanish, he indicated that he had explosives and demanded to be flown to Cuba. The aircraft diverted to Havana, Cuba. After landing, Cuban authorities boarded the aircraft and took the hijackers into custody."
123,ACC624,"While the aircraft was en route between Fort Lauderdale, FL to Tampa, FL, the hijacker handed a note to a flight attendant indicating that he had an explosive device and directed that the aircraft be flown to Havana, Cuba. He then opened a small athletic bag revealing an alleged bomb. The pilot diverted the aircraft to Havana and after landing the hijacker was taken into custody by Cuban authorities."
124,ACC625,Just after touchdown the aircraft rolled over a frost heave on the runway surface and began veering to the right. The pilot applied left brake and added power to the right engine but the aircraft continued going right until the right wing struck a hill adjacent to the right side of the runway. The aircraft came to rest in a ditch 110 degrees to the right of the landing runway heading. Examination of the right main landing gear tire revealed a large jagged opening in the sidewall which extended into the tread area of the tire. This opening matched one of the sides of a rock found in the vicinity of the frost heave. The aircraft maintenance logbooks were reviewed and found to have no record of compliance with airworthiness directives.
125,ACC626,"While enroute to Tampa, FL, the airplane was hijacked by three passengers. One of the hijackers grabbed a flight attendant and held a knife to her throat. The other two armed with a knife and an aerosol can left their seats and shouted ""Cuba"" several times. One of the men briefly ignited the gases emitted from the aerosol can.The pilot diverted the aircraft to Havana, Cuba.Cuban authorities boarded the aircraft and took the hijackers into custody."
126,ACC627,"A few minutes after departure from Tampa, FL, a male passenger threatened a flight attendant with a knife and forced her to sit in the seat beside him. He directed her to tell another flight attendant to tell the pilot to go to Cuba, whereupon the captain headed for Havana, Cuba.When refreshments were served, the hijacker placed the knife on his seat between his legs in order to accept a drink with his free hand while holding the flight attendant with the other hand. Two passengers near the hijacker then attacked and subdued him.The aircraft landed at Miami, FL and the hijacker was taken into custody. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for air piracy."
127,ACC628,"Boeing 767 C-GAUN was one of four brand new 767's delivered to Air Canada at the time of the accident. On July 22, 1983 C-GAUN underwent a routine service check in Edmonton Airport (YEG), Canada. During this check the three fuel quantity indicators, situated on an overhead panel between the two pilots, were found to be blank. The technician found that he could obtain fuel indication by pulling and deactivating the channel 2 circuit breaker. He marked the circuit breaker 'inoperative' and made an entry in the log book. Because the fuel quantity system was not redundant anymore, the fuel load had to be confirmed by the use of the fuel measuring sticks located under the wings of the aircraft.The following day the 767 was flown to Montreal via Ottawa (YOW). A crew change took place for the return flight, AC143 to Edmonton. Before the new flight crew arrived on board, a technician entered the cockpit. He noted the entry made in the log book and saw the circuit breaker which had been pulled and tagged. He was confused by the entry in the log book which did not appear to coincide with what he had been taught about the processor in recent training. Because of his confusion, he attempted a self-test of the system and reset the number 2 channel circuit breaker. This caused the fuel gauges in the cockpit to go blank. Not being satisfied with the test, he decided that the ´Fuel Quantity Information System Processor´ had to be replaced. However, none were available in Montreal. On returning to the flight deck, the technician was distracted by the arrival of the fueller and forgot to pull the number 2 circuit breaker again. When the captain for the return flight arrived on board, he saw the blank fuel gauges. This did not surprise him. In a brief conversation with the arriving crew, he was told that the fuel gauges were inoperative and that a fuel drip had to be done to ascertain the amount of fuel on the aircraft. Similarly, the log book entry further confirmed his false assumption about the fuel gauges.The captain then consulted the Minimum Equipment List (MEL), which clearly indicates that the aircraft was not legal to go with blank fuel gauges. Nevertheless, because of the mistaken assumption already in his mind, the captain formed the opinion that he could safely take and fly the aircraft, provided the fuel quantity on board the aircraft was confirmed by use of the fuel quantity measuring sticks in the fuel tanks. Because of the problem with the gauges, it was decided to load enough fuel to go right through to Edmonton with a drip check to be made both in Montreal and in Ottawa.Maintenance crew at Montreal calculated the 767's fuel load by hand. They dripped the tanks and the flightcrew calculated the total amount of fuel by using 1.77 pounds/litre as the specific gravity factor. This was the factor written on the refueler's slip and used on all of the other planes in Air Canada's fleet. On the all-metric Boeing 767 however they should have used 0.8 kg/litre of kerosene. The aircraft departed Montreal and landed at Ottawa, a scheduled stop on its way to Edmonton. At Ottawa the plane was re-dripped and the crew were told 11,430 liters of fuel were on board. The flightcrew then thought they had 20,400 kilos of fuel (instead of only 9144 kilos !). This amount was entered in the FMS. En route to Edmonton, at FL410, the EICAS warned low fuel pressure in the left fuel pump. The captain at once decided to divert the flight to Winnipeg, then 120 miles (192 km) away, and commenced a descent. Within seconds, warning lights appeared indicating loss of pressure in the right main fuel tank. Within minutes, the left engine failed, followed by failure of the right engine. The aircraft was then at 35,000 feet, 65 miles (104 km) from Winnipeg and 45 miles (72 km) from Gimli. Without power to generate electricity all the electronic gauges in the cockpit became blank, leaving only stand-by instruments, consisting of a magnetic compass, an artificial horizon, an airspeed indicator and an altimeter. Vectors were given to Gimli. The captain, who had flying experience on a glider, used gliding techniques to manoeuver the airplane for the approach. The landing gear was lowered, but the nose gear could not be lowered and locked. The 767 touched down on runway 32L within 800 feet of the threshold. The nose contacted the runway and the airplane came to rest short of a part of the runway which was at the time being used as a drag racing strip."
128,ACC629,"A few minutes after takeoff from Miami, FL a male passenger stood up and shouted ""Tell them to take this national to Cuba"". He displayed a plastic bottle containing a liquid that smelled like either kerosene or gasoline. Reportedly, he poured the liquid over his own head and doused his clothing and the seat he occupied. He lit a candle and then seated himself. He remained seated during the flight, keeping a candle burning continuously while holding it slightly in front of him or above his head. The captainwas advised and diverted the aircraft to Havana, Cuba. At Havana, Cuban authorities boarded the aircraft and took custody of the hijacker and his possessions."
129,ACC630,"A Beechcraft 200 Super King Air aircraft, VH-KTE, broke up in flight and crashed to the ground 3.5 kilometres south of Adavale. The pilot-in-command and the 11 passengers were killed when the aircraft fuselage, devoid of wings and empennage, impacted the ground, inverted."
130,ACC631,"The Islander went missing during a flight from Campbell River to Smithers, British Columbia, Canada. On board were six fishermen/hunters. The search was called off after four weeks."
131,ACC632,"The aircraft crashed after the crew had issued a brief distress message. It appeared that a bomb had exploded in the cargo compartment, causing a violent fire."
132,ACC633,Crashed into the sea in bad weather.
133,ACC634,"After two missed IFR approaches to runway 22 a VFR approach was conducted. While turning in, the aircraft struck the ground just short of the runway threshold."
134,ACC635,The no. 1 engine failed on climbout. The Twin Otter struck trees on a high ground while turning left.
135,ACC636,Damaged on landing.
136,ACC637,"While enroute to Newark, NJ, a male passenger grabbed a flight attendant and advised her that he had a gun.The hijacker demanded that the flight be diverted to Atlantic City, NJ. Upon landing in Atlantic City, the hijacker with a flight attendant as hostage left the aircraftand entered the air terminal operations building where he released the flight attendant and demanded a taxi to Atlantic City proper.FBI and local officials entered the building and arrested the hijacker. While searching the hijacker for the alleged weapon, over $600 in cash taken from a flight attendant was recovered. The man was committed to a mental institution."
137,ACC638,"The aircraft operated on a training flight from Smolensk-Severny Air Base. In adverse weather conditions the An-12 suffered from severe icing. It eventually became uncontrollable and crashed in a silage pit on the premises of the kolkhoz (collective farm) ""Krasny Dobrovolets"" some 500 metres south of Senkovo."
138,ACC639,"A DHC-6 Twin Otter passenger plane, operated by Austin Airways, was damaged beyond repair in an accident near Lansdowne House Airport, ON (YLH).There were 2 crew and 5 passengers on board of which 4 passengers were asphyxiated in the post crash fire. The 1 surviving passenger suffered serious injuries and the crew escaped with minor or no injuries.The airplane operated on a domestic flight from Sandy Lake Airport, ON (ZSJ). Visibility at Lansdowne House was poor due to heavy snow snowfallAfter executing an overshoot, the captain flew a second circuit without losing sight of the airfield. The aircraft turned toward the runway. The pilot called 'runway in sight' and shortly thereafter, the co-pilot noticed the radio altimeter pass through 200 feet. Moments before impact, the captain reported to the 1st officer that he was encountering whiteout conditions and moved to advance the power levers.The aircraft was in line with the runway when it struck the snow-covered ice surface of the lake, about 1200 feet short of the runway threshold. The nose gear assembly was broken off at first impact. The aircraft then slid and rotated 180 degrees counter clockwise, struck large rocks on the shore and stopped 600 feet short of the runway.The rear spars of each wing were separated from the fuselage; the fuel tanks were ruptured and the fuel lines were broken. Fire broke out on impact."
139,ACC640,"A Fokker F-28 Fellowship 2000 passenger jet, registered 5N-ANF, was damaged beyond repair in an accident 3,3 km from Enugu Airport (ENU), Nigeria. There were 66 passengers and six crew members on board. The airplane operated on a Nigeria Airways flight from Lagos/Ikeja International Airport (LOS) to Enugu Airport (ENU).A VOR approach was attempted although the airport visibility was reported to be below minima. While first maintaining MDA at or below 300 ft above local terrain and apparently manoeuvring to regain track while passing the VOR, the aircraft was suddenly made to descend, less than two miles short of the threshold. The aircraft was still in approach configuration. At initial impact, which was in a nearly level attitude in flat terrain covered with high grass, the landing gears were torn off or collapsed. The aircraft then slid on its belly, while shedding pieces, into a cassavaterrain consisting of a regular pattern of mounds of about 1 metre high and some trees. One of these trees cut the left wing slightly outboard of the root collector tank and the wing separated further on. The left engine and nacelle were torn off as well, including a large piece of side wall, floor structure and aft pressure bulkhead. Aft fuselage and empennage further separated behind the pressure bulkhead. In view of the damage to the aft fuselage parts, it is likely that the aircraft travelled in a taildown nose-high attitude during some part of the ground slide.The front fuselage bottom was severely compressed, the cargo holds were ruptured and their contents dispersed. Due to the right wing trailing on the mounds and hitting some smaller trees, the final slide relative to the fuselage was sideward to the left.A fire erupted at the separated wing and engine and gradually made its way towards the fuselage remains."
140,ACC641,"The pilot returned to Melbourne-Essendon Airport, Australia, at about 1700 hrs local time on 4 December 1983 after having operated for some time in Tasmania. On his arrival he refuelled the aircraft and completed a flight plan for the flight to Adelaide and Kalgoorlie the following morning. At about 04:30 hours the next morning the pilot submitted the flight plan to Melbourne Briefing Office prior to obtaining a forecast of the upper winds for the route and terminal area forecasts for Adelaide and Kalgoorlie. To calculate the time intervals for the two legs of the proposed flight the pilot had assumed a headwind component of 50 knots. However, the forecast given to the pilot indicated that the headwind component for the Essendon to Adelaide leg at the planned level, flight level 310, was about 90 knots, and for the Adelaide to Kalgoorlie leg at planned level, flight level 370, was about 100 knots. The flight plan also gave the fuel endurance of the aircraft as 200 minutes ex Essendon and 300 minutes ex Adelaide. The aircraft subsequently departed Essendon and arrived in Adelaide after an apparently uneventful flight. The pilot left a note to instruct the aircraft refuellers to refuel the aircraft to full tanks and proceeded to the Adelaide Briefing Office. At the Briefing Office the pilot obtained updated weather forecasts which indicated that Kalgoorlie required an alternate. The pilot then advised the Briefing Officer that he would nominate Perth as the alternate. When he was then told that the fuel endurance necessary to plan Perth as an alternate would be 302 minutes, the pilot changed the flight plan to indicate that the fuel endurance of the aircraft ex Adelaide was 320 minutes. At the flight levels planned a fuel endurance of 320 minutes could not be obtained. The pilot also decided to fly the leg at flight level 290 as the head winds at that level were less than at the higher level, although still almost twice the strength of the flight planned headwind. When the pilot returned to the aircraft he found that it had not been refuelled as requested. He then assisted the refuellers to refuel the aircraft by adding the anti-icing agent to the fuel during the operation. Because of the delay the normal fuelling procedure was not carried out and as a result the fuel tanks were not filled to capacity. About an hour after departing Adelaide the aircraft entered cloud and encountered icing conditions. The pilot switched on the engine anti-ice and the cruise was continued at flight level 290 for about 30 minutes before climbing to flight level 310, clear of cloud where anti-icing was turned off. Operating with engine anti-ice on increases the fuel consumption by 8 percent. As the aircraft approached the mid-point of the flight the pilot became concerned that he may not have sufficient fuel to continue the flight from Kalgoorlie to the alternate, Perth. He decided to continue the flight towards Kalgoorlie and if the alternate requirement was not lifted when he was at a point along track that was 30 minutes beyond Caiguna, he would return to and land at Caiguna. Shortly afterwards the alternate requirement was lifted on Kalgoorlie. When 185 kilometres east of Kalgoorlie the pilot commenced the descent and at flight level 250 the aircraft entered cloud and the engine anti-ice was again switched on. During the descent the fuel low level warning light illuminated and the left engine surged and flamed out at 10,000 feet. The pilot unsuccessfully attempted to restart the engine. As the aircraft broke clear of cloud at 1000 feet above ground level the right engine also flamed out. The pilot made a distress call and landed the aircraft, gear up, on a fire break. After touchdown the aircraft skidded 400 metres before coming to rest. The examination of the aircraft found that during the landing the left fuel tank had been breached, however no evidence was found of any significant fuel spillage. Approximately five litres of fuel was recovered from each of the left and right fuel tanks. The engine fuel filters and fuel lines provided only a small amount of residual fuel. The inspection of the remainder of the aircraft did not reveal any defects that could have contributed to the accident."
141,ACC642,"Weather conditions for Paulatuk included a strong crosswind at 25-30 knots and blowing snow. The pilot attempted to carry out an overshoot, but the left wing contacted the ground and the aircraft cartwheeled. This happened during a transition from visual to instrument flight. The aircraft was overloaded by 840 lb."
142,ACC643,"While taxiing out in fog, the KAL crew became disoriented and ended up on the wrong runway. During the takeoff run, the aircraft collided head-on with South Central Air Flight 59, a Piper PA-31 which was taking off from runway 06L-24R for a flight to Kenai. The 9 occupants of N35206 were injured. The DC-10 overran the runway by 1434 feet and came to rest 40 feet right of the extended centreline."
143,ACC644,"An in-flight explosion after leaving Karachi blew a 2 m x 2 m hole in the right rear cargo hold no.4 and caused a loss of cabin pressure. An emergency descent to 5000 feet was made and the aircraft returned to Karachi.Flight 171 originated in Manila, Philippines and was heading for Paris, France with en route stops at Bangkok, Thailand, Karachi, Pakistan and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia."
144,ACC645,"During the descent into Izhevsk Airport (IJK), Russia, the Antonov 24 suffered an elevator control failure. The crew attempted to use the elevator trim during their approach.The first approach was flown at a speed of 270 km/h and flaps at 15° but the crew decided to abandon the approach because the nose pitched up. The second approach was flown at 250 km/h. flaps 15° and the elevator trim tab at +15°. The airplane fell to the right at a height of 3-5 m on finals and collided with the ground near the runway. The investigation revealed that a nut of the elevator controls had not been attached correctly during maintenance. In service the nut loosened until the controls failed several days later."
145,ACC646,"The Boeing 737 had taken off from Huambo and was climbing through 8000 feet when an explosion occurred in the rear of the cabin. The crew returned to Huambo for an emergency landing. Because of severed hydraulic lines it was impossible to extend the flaps. The aircraft touched down fast and overran the runway by 180 m. Just 3 months prior to this accident, TAAG had lost another Boeing 737."
146,ACC647,"The aircraft was engaged on a night freighter service from Cairns (CNS) to Brisbane (BNE) with intermediate stops at Townsville (TSV) and Proserpine (PPP). The flight departed Cairns at 18:47 hours. After arriving at Townsville the aircraft was refuelled and additional freight loaded before departing for Proserpine at 19:47 hours. The aircraft was cleared to track direct to Proserpine on climb to FL250. At 20:08 hours the pilot reported that the aircraft had left FL250 on descent into Proserpine and requested a clearance to track to intercept the 310 omni radial inbound for a DME Arrival. This request was approved and a short time later the aircraft reported established on the radial. At 20:16 hours, in answer to a question from Townsville Control, the aircraft reported at 2600 feet and was instructed to call Townsville Flight Service Unit. The aircraft complied with this instruction, and after the initial contact no further transmissions were received from the aircraft. The wreckage was located approximately 4 kilometres north-west of the threshold of runway 11 and in line with that runway. The aircraft had been destroyed by impact forces and the ensuing fire. A witness, who lived near the final approach path of the aircraft, reported that she observed the aircraft when it was on final approach. Analysis of her observations indicated that when she sighted the aircraft it was at a lower height than normal for the type of approach that the pilot reported would be flown. At the time of the sighting she did not notice anything unusual about the operation of the aircraft. Other persons at the Proserpine Aerodrome at the time of the accident reported rainstorms and strong winds in the vicinity. An inspection of the aircraft and its systems did not reveal any defect that could have contributed to the accident. Despite the extensive investigation, no evidence could be found to indicate why the aircraft was below the normal glide path during the approach."
147,ACC648,The C-130E Hercules departed Zaragoza on a low-level supply drop training mission. Weather in the area included a 1200-feet ceiling with 6 km visibility. The Hercules struck the face of a mesa at an elevation of 2200 feet.

150,ACC651,"Pacific Western Airlines scheduled early morning flight 501 to Edmonton was pushed-back from the gate at 07:35. After engine start the aircraft taxied to runway 34 for departure.Takeoff was begun at 07:42 from the intersection of runway 34 and taxiway C-1. About 20 seconds into the takeoff roll, at an airspeed of approximately 70 knots, the flightcrew heard a loud bang which was accompanied by a slight veer to the left. The captain immediately rejected the takeoff using brakes and reverse thrust. Both the crew members suspected a tire on the left main landing gear had blown. The captain decided to taxi clear of the runway at taxiway C-4. Approaching C-4, the crew a.o. noted that left engine low pressure unit rpm was indicating 0 per cent.Twenty-three seconds after the initiation of the rejected takeoff, the first officer called clear of the runway on tower frequency: ""501 clear here on Charlie 4"". The purser then entered the flight deck and reported a fire on the left wing. The control tower then confirmed that there was a fire: ""Considerable amount off the back - on the left side engine there - and - eh - it's starting to diminish there. Eh - there's a fire going on the left side."" One minute and two seconds had passed since the initiation of the rejected takeoff. Immediately after this the purser further stated that ""the whole left-hand side, the whole back side of it is burning"". The captain discharged a fire bottle into the engine and the first officer requested emergency equipment.At an elapsed time of 1 minute 36 seconds, the cockpit fire warning bell activated. Simultaneously, the purser re-entered the cockpit and reported that it was getting bad at the back. The captain stopped the aircraft the crew then carried out the procedures for an emergency evacuation, which was initiated at an elapsed time of 1 minute 55 seconds."
151,ACC652,"A man claiming to be a member of the Black Liberation Army hijacked Piedmont Flight PI451. He claimed to have explosives and two accomplices and demanded to be taken to Cuba.Among the demands of the hijacker was 5 million dollars and the release of his brother from a South African prison. The captain of the aircraft advised the hijacker that there was not sufficient fuel to go to Havana. The hijacker informed the captain that if the plane did not go to Cuba, there were two people aboard who would start shooting passengers. Shortly thereafter, the hijacker locked himself in the lavatory. Upon landing in Havana, Cuban officials boarded the aircraft and took custody of the hijacker who was still in the lavatory.No weapons or explosives were found. The hijacker was reportedly sentenced in Cuba to 15 years in prison."
152,ACC653,"Approximately 20 minutes after departure from New Orleans, LA, a male passenger stood up holding a whiskey bottle with brown liquid and demanded to be flown to Cuba.He threatened to pour the liquid on a flight attendant and ignite it if his demand was not met. The pilot diverted the aircraft to Cuba where the flight landed without further incident.Cuban authorities boarded the aircraft in Havana and took the hijacker into custody."
153,ACC654,"The pilot was attempting a takeoff on an airstrip where braking action was considered good during the normal summer season. It was about 3000 ft in elevation and was snow covered most of the year, as on the day of the accident. The strip accommodated takeoffs to the south only due to grading and obstructions. Frequently, this meant a downwind takeoff. On the day of the accident, there was a 5 kt wind from the north with gusts to 10 kts. The pilot said that nose wheel steering was not effective due to the surface and the rudder was not responsive due to the tailwind. Most pilots used a 25 degree (right turn) dogleg of the runway at the north end to start their takeoff, especially when tailwinds were present. The accident aircraft went off the runway to the left and collided with a snowbank where it nosed over."
154,ACC655,"The Tu-134 jet was attached to the Voroshilovgrad Higher Military Aviation School of Navigators and operated on a flight from Zhdanov (now Mariupol) to Voroshilovgrad (now Lugansk). The school's commander was on board as a passenger.Twelve minutes after takeoff, at height of 4200 m, strong oscillations in pitch and a roll occurred. The plane suffered big vertical and lateral loadings and descended to 2750 m. After 38 seconds it disintegrated in mid-air. During repairs at a military maintenance facility, two wires on the electrical circuit of the back-up yaw damper had been cross-wired. The main yaw-damper performed uneventful. On the accident flight however the plane passed through a zone of strong turbulence. The back-up yaw damper then kicked in, sending wrong commands to the elevator and the ailerons."
155,ACC656,"The left main gear failed to lock down and collapsed during the landing roll. The damper lever jack, the main jack, and the lever stay link of the left gear assembly had failed in overload before the emergency landing. The cause of the failure could not be determined.The ST-27 was converted from a Royal Air Force Queen´s Flight de Havilland Heron CC.Mk4 (c/n 14141), serial XR391."
156,ACC657,"Loganair flight LC 621 was scheduled to fly from Kirkwall, on Orkney Island, to the Islands of Stronsay and Sanday, departing from Kirkwall at 07:30. The weather at Kirkwall was predominantly misty with low cloud and thus unsuitable for an on-schedule departure; accordingly, the commander decided to delay the flight pending an improvement. Because there are no formal weather reporting facilities at Stronsay or Sanday, crews must rely upon the area forecast and on any informal information passed by the respective aerodrome attendants. At about 07:25 hrs, the two airfield attendants telephoned, in turn, to say that the weather at Sanday was suitable for landing and that at Stronsay the visibility was then about 1½ miles. At 07:50 the commander decided that the weather conditions at Kirkwall were now better than the published takeoff minima and that the flight could be conducted under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR). Accordingly, the BN-2 Islander took off for Stronsay with six passengers on board. The flight was uneventful and the aircraft landed at Stronsay at 07:58. There two passengers disembarked and three joined for the 6 mile flight to Sanday, which departed at 08:03. As they passed the south-west tip of Sanday Island, the visibility was 2 miles with very low patchy stratus and with a higher layer of cloud. The pilot therefore flew the route below the upper layer of cloud, at 300 feet amsl and at a reduced airspeed of 90 knots, compared with the normal cruising speed of 130 knots. When the aircraft was about 3/4 mile out from Sanday airfield the commander recognised the chequered marker boards near the end of the grass runway 03. He next saw the windsock, which showed the wind to be about 140°/15-20 knots, and slowly descended to 250 feet amsl (190 feet above the aerodrome) to position the aircraft downwind for runway 11. Whilst doing so, he lost sight of the airfield in deteriorating visibility and, as the cloudbase ahead appeared to be getting lower, he climbed away in a northwesterly direction and levelled off above the layer of cloud, at 600 feet amsl. Whilst establishing the aircraft on the track to Kirkwall, the commander noticed some areas clear of cloud about 3 miles off the northwest coast of Sanday. As, in the opinion of the commander, these provided a safe area for descent over the sea, he used them to descend to 300 feet again and approached the northwest coast at 90 knots with the intention of map-reading his way back to Sanday aerodrome. Having carried out the descent and the relevant aircraft checks the commander saw the headland, which he knew to be Whale Point, some 2-3 miles distant. By reference to his map he was aware that he could follow the road which ran in a southwesterly direction and then turn southeast to a specific point which would lead him directly onto the final approach to runway 11. However, having failed to recognise the turning point, he navigated by reference to his map around the south, east and north of the aerodrome in order to intercept the road running southwest and thus relocate the turn-in point to the runway. The commander stated that he was aware that the meteorological conditions were very conducive to the formation of carburettor icing, so he applied the normal period of carburettor heat to each engine just before the final approach. He then turned the aircraft onto the final approach and, not yet seeing the airfield, used the school - which he could see and knew to be almost directly beneath the final approach path - to align the aircraft with the runway. As the aircraft passed abeam of the school the commander was able to identify the runway markers of runway 11. By this time the aircraft speed had reduced from the 65 knots at which the approach had been flown, but the speed actually achieved is not known. The left wing of the aircraft then dropped and the aircraft established a rate of sink. The stall warning system activated and the application of full throttle could not arrest the descent before ground contact. During this final descent, the aircraft turned through 55° to the left and struck the ground in a manner quoted by some passengers as not very different from a normal landing, although at a point some 450 feet (137 metres) short of the runway threshold. Thinking that the aircraft had merely bounced on the ground, the commander left the power applied and attempted to climb away. With full throttle still applied, the aircraft continued through two barbed wire fences, across a small quarry and a shallow ditch. It finally came to rest, after passing through another barbed wire fence, some 1,065 feet (325 metres) from the initial impact point. The commander then closed the throttles and shut down the engines."
157,ACC658,Indian Airlines flight 266 to Calcutta was forced to fly two holdings due to poor weather at Calcutta Airport.During the ILS approach the captain reported runway in sight 90 seconds prior to touchdown and the aircraft was cleared to land. The controller cautioned that the runway was wet. After touchdown the aircraft rolled 1800 feet until it went off the left side of the runway. The aircraft entered kucha ground and the nose landing gear collapsed.
158,ACC659,"While turning from base leg onto final approach the fight controls suddenly collapsed forward and the nose of the aircraft pitched up. The pilot tried to maintain control by using throttle and flap control. The Twin Otter then collided with the terminal building and a vehicle. It appeared that the elevator control cable was rusted and broken at Station 376 and the cable pulley in the area was also damaged. The cable hadn't been inspected for 725.9 hours, while inspection is required every 700 hours. The corrosion process was speeded up by the fact that the aircraft was operated in a high humidity and marine salt environment. The aircraft had also carried large amounts of salt pork and corned beef in the aft cargo compartment, directly above the corroded cable area."
159,ACC660,"The An-2 came in too fast on landing, touched down only 315 m after the runway threshold, overshot the runway and collided with an obstacle."
160,ACC661,"The Varsity aircraft was a twin engined training aircraft used by the Royal Air Force until 1974 when it was sold into private ownership. It was currently owned and operated by an aircraft preservation group who maintained the aircraft to its service specification. For this reason it carried the military designation ""WJ897"" on the fuselage and wings although it was registered as G-BDFT. The aircraft had been granted a Permit to Fly and was restricted to display and demonstration flying and the practising for such displays. Thirteen members of the society had boarded the aircraft earlier that morning at RAF Syerston in Nottinghamshire, where the aircraft was hangared, for the short flight to East Midlands Airport (EMA). This flight was uneventful and, after landing, the aircraft was refuelled with 436 imperial gallons of aviation gasoline (Avgas 100 LL) increasing the total fuel on board to 510 imp gals.It was intended to fly to Liverpool Airport (LPL) to take part in an air display that afternoon. It was arranged that aerial photographs of the Varsity would be taken during the flight to Liverpool using a Cessna 180. This aircraft was to rendezvous with the Varsity at 3000 feet amsl in the area of Blithfield Reservoir some 20 miles to the west of East Midlands Airport. The Varsity engines were normally started using a ground electrical supply. On this occasion, the left engine was reluctant to start and after it initially fired, it faltered and stopped, emitting smoke from the exhaust. For fear of exhausting the batteries with repeated attempts to start, the right engine was started first. The left engine was then motored over before another start attempt was made, this time successfully. The passengers on the Varsity were told that the left engine had been over primed on the first attempt to start.The Varsity took off at 09:32 and the approach controller at East Midlands Airport provided bearing and range information to the Varsity pilot to help him locate the Cessna 180 and, at 09:47 hrs, both aircraft changed to a discrete radio frequency. The Varsity was then flown in formation on the right hand side of the Cessna in a series of wide orbits of the Blithfield Reservoir. During this time, the left engine of the Varsity was seen to emit occasional puffs of smoke accompanied by loud bangs. When the photographer requested that the Varsity climb slightly above the Cessna and lower its undercarriage, the Varsity pilot reported that he was having trouble with the right engine. The Cessna pilot replied that it looked to him as if the problem was in fact with the left engine, as he could see puffs of smoke as if the engine were running too rich. When the Varsity pilot replied that it might be engine icing, the Cessna pilot noted that his intake temperature was indicating in the range where there was no risk of intake icing on his engine. The undercarriage of the Varsity was lowered briefly before being retracted again with the pilot's comment that he ""could not accept the drag and might have to abort the photography"". Towards the end of the photographic flying, the right engine started to backfire as well.At 10:05, the Varsity pilot called East Midlands Airport on the approach frequency requesting a direct return to the airport because he had some engine problems and might have to declare an emergency. In reply the approach controller passed the Varsity a course to steer to East Midlands and asked whether the Varsity could maintain height. The pilot answered that ""at the present we are able to but it's with some difficulty"". The Varsity steadily losing height and, at 10:07, the pilot informed the controller that the left engine of the Varsity had stopped. Thirty seconds later the Varsity co-pilot radioed ""we're going to have to put it down in the nearest field, we're down to 400 feet and losing power on both engines so we are going into the..."". The undercarriage of the Varsity was lowered and, at a very low height, the left wing was then seen to drop and the aircraft rolled over, the nose dropped and it crashed inverted. Just before impact the left mainplane severed 11,000 volt electricity supply wires. As the aircraft broke-up on impact, the rear part of the fuselage together with the empennage fell into a drainage ditch some 10 feet deep. The three survivors were seated in rearward facing seats in this part of the fuselage. Two were able to escape from the fuselage but the third was hampered by a broken leg and received severe burns when a wire fence prevented him from leaving the accident area."
161,ACC662,"During the 1984 Farnborough International Air Display de Havilland Canada was to fly a display using DHC-5D C-GCTC, DHC-6 Twin Otter C-GFJQ, and both Dash 7 and Dash 8 prototypes C-GNBX and C-GDNK. Brakes were released at 16:16 and the Buffalo commenced its takeoff run as the third aircraft in the DHC combine behind the Dash 7 and Dash 8. Immediately after takeoff the Buffalo carried out a steep climb to a height of 1000 feet agl. Following a descending turn to the right, the airplane carried out a low level flypast along the display line at height of 250 feet agl and an airspeed of 215 kts. The Buffalo then entered a climbing turn to the left through about 270 degrees, before reversing bank in order to position for a right hand final approach for a STOL landing back onto runway 25. During this manoeuvre the landing gear was selected down and the copilot lowered the ramp and opened the rear cargo door. At a height of 450 feet agl the nose dropped significantly and the rate of descent increased. The DHC-5 continued in a steep side-slipping and descending turn to the right. Shortly before touchdown the rate of descent reduced slightly. The aircraft then landed very hard. The nose gear collapsed, both wings failed and the propellers disintegrated after contacting the runway. Debris caused some damage to vehicles and three aircraft in the static display area."
162,ACC663,"Crashed into Mount Musaka.The airplane was on a flight from Tabubil Airport (TBG) in the Western Province, PNG to Telefomin Airport (TFM) in the West Sepik Province, PNG. The flight originated at Wewak Airport (WWK) in the East Sepik Province, PNG. Its final intended destination was Kiunga Airport (UNG) in the Western province were it was based."
163,ACC664,Crashed on takeoff during an aviation event. The aircraft reached a height of only 20 m before it crashed.With 26 passengers the aircraft was overloaded.
164,ACC665,"The aircraft departed Fort Norman at 16:51 and arrived overhead Fort Franklin at approximately 17:15. Because Fort Franklin was shrouded in fog, a local resident contacted the pilot on a portable VHF transceiver and advised him that there was little or no visibility. The pilot replied that he did not think he would be able to land. The resident drove to the airstrip and contacted the pilot again when he heard the aircraft returning. He advised the pilot that visibility was 200-300 feet. The pilot then asked if this was the vertical or horizontal visibility. At that moment the Twin Otter struck a 200-foot-high telecommunications tower while in controlled level fight. Part of the right wing broke off and the aircraft slowly rolled over before striking the ground. The decision of the pilot to continue the approach in foggy weather were possibly influenced by the effects of stress and a greater than usual personal need to complete the flight. The stress was probably caused by the fact that the pilot had been involved in four accidents since March 1984. Although he was a very experienced pilot, his previous employer terminated his employment on 31 August 1984. In their opinion, his ability to make operational decisions was in question. The pilot was hired by Nahanni Air Services one month later."
165,ACC666,"The Twin Otter departed Goose Bay on a medical evacuation flight to St. Anthony. The flight was uneventful and landed in St. Anthony at 15:24. At 16:02, the aircraft departed St. Anthony on a VFR flight back to Goose Bay. On board were the two pilots and the doctor and nurse. Approaching the Goose Bay Airport, weather became marginal, but the crew continued visual flight. The crew likely encountered near zero forward visibility in snow showers and fog; it is probable that they were able to maintain vertical contact with the ground and were confident they could continue flight with visual reference to the ground. The crew may not have been able to see terrain ahead and therefore may not have been able to determine if the aircraft would clear the hills, particularly, when steep hills were encountered. The plane struck a rock outcropping 100 feet below the summit of a 2,050-foot mountain. After bouncing twice, the Twin Otter had come to rest in a small, wooded gully, approximately 350 feet from the initial point of impact."
166,ACC667,"Aeroflot Flight 3352 was a regular domestic service from Krasnodar to Omsk and Novosibirsk, Soviet Union (now Russia).The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154B-1, took off from Krasnodar at  23:37 hours Moscow time. At 05:15 local time (02:15 Moscow time), three vehicles were dispatched to the runway at Omsk Airport to carry out work. The vehicles were not equipped with radios that would allow listening to the tower frequency, nor with rotating flashing beacons. Meanwhile, flight 3352 was descending towards Omsk. Visibility was 3000 m, with rain, and haze. Temperature was +3°C and ceiling was measured at 110 m.At 05:33, the landing controller turned on the runway lights. The aircraft touched down at 05:39 hours. Immediately after touching down at a speed of about 140 knots the crew noticed vehicles on the runway. An evasive manoeuvre was of no avail as the aircraft struck three vehicles and a fire erupted. Four occupants of the vehicles and 174 occupants of the aircraft died in the crash.One of the controllers had fallen asleep and thus failed to inform the approach controller about the presence of the vehicles on the runway."
167,ACC668,"The An-12 flew to Khost (KHT), carrying a load of blankets and two tanks with gasoline. After landing the blankets and one tank of gasoline were unloaded. At that moment the plane came under mortar fire. Several crew members were injured.The crew managed to take-off with the damaged aircraft from the taxiway, starting up three of the engines while already moving and landed back at Kabul. The airplane was substantially damaged; some 150 punctures caused by the shrapnel were found."
168,ACC669,"Due to low oil pressure and high oil temperature the right engine was secured. During the precautionary landing, gear extension was delayed until aprx 800 ft agl. Since the right engine powers the only hydraulic pump, a landing gear down and locked condition was not possible by the normal means. As the gear were extended and hydraulic pressure began to decrease the pilot realized that normal gear extension would not occur. The altitude of the aircraft precluded the emergency extension of the landing gear. Shortly after touchdown on runway 26L the right main landing gear collapsed."
169,ACC670,Shot down by a shoulder-fired 'Strela' SAM. The missile hit the wing between the engines number 1 and 2.On board were 25 tons of cargo.
170,ACC671,The Twin Otter flew into a hill near the border with Peru. The airplane carried a dual military serial: FAE-446.
171,ACC672,"At a height of about 200 feet after take-off the right engine lost power. The pilot feathered the propeller and commenced a gentle left turn in order to return to the strip. He later advised that the aircraft began to sink towards some large trees and he was forced to increase the angle of bank in an effort to avoid them. Shortly afterwards the aircraft struck the ground heavily in an adjacent paddock about 1 kilometer from the strip. The engine failure was caused by jamming of accessory drive gearing as a result of the effects of excessive wear within a magneto. It was probable that a mandatory inspection of the magneto which fell due 84 flying hours before the accident, was not conducted. On take-off the aircraft weight exceeded the authorised limit, however following the engine failure the pilot was able to maintain straight and level flight. A cleared area of ground lay ahead and just to the left of the flight path but the pilot had considered the aircraft had sufficient performance capability to permit a return to the strip."
172,ACC673,"After a refueling stop in Dubai (DXB) while en-route to Karachi (KHI), the aircraft was hijacked to Tehran (THR) by four heavily armed Arabs. Over the nextsix days the hijackers released 153 passengers and crew in several groups. The hijackers demanded the release of 17 prisoners, jailed in Kuwait for bomb attacks on U.S. and French installations. While the aircraft was in Tehran, the hijackers beat and tortured at least six passengers and killed two American passengers.Kuwait authorities refused to release the militants from jail. The hijacking ended on December 9, 1984 when Iranian security forces boarded the aircraft and overpowered the hijackers. The hijackers were believed to have been linked to the Iraqi underground organization ""Al Dawa""."
173,ACC674,"A Let L-410MA passenger plane was destroyed when it crashed near Kostroma, Russia. All 15 passengers and two pilots were killed.The airplane was climbing through an altitude of 1500 m after takeoff from Kostroma Airport (KMW) when the artificial horizon failed. The airplane was in clouds and the crew lost spatial orientation. The aircraft entered a descent with increasing bank. At an altitude of 500-600 m it came out of the clouds, allowing the crew to correct the attitude of the aircraft. While pulling out of the dive, the plane went back into the clouds. The crew again lost spatial orientation and the plane now went into a steep dive, rapidly losing altitude. The pilots could not regain control and the airplane struck trees and terrain."
174,ACC675,"At 18:12, flight 1039 was cleared for takeoff from runway 31. At 18:13, while over the departure end of the runway and climbing through 600 feet, the crew acknowledged a frequency change. Thirty seconds later, the airplane was seen in a steep a descent near the extended centerline of the runway. The Bandeirante struck the ground 7,800 feet beyond the departure end of runway 31 and 85 feet to the right of the extended runway centerline in an inverted nose down attitude, after which it caught fire and burned. Before ground impact, the horizontal stabilizer, including bulkhead No. 36, had separated from the fuselage. Both elevators and elevator tips, the tail cone assembly, and the aft portion of the ventral fin also had separated in flight."
175,ACC676,The aircraft was engaged in an IFR training flight from Dar Es Salaam Airport. The flight was to head to Bagamoyo (radial 331/30nm) with a procedure turn at there before returning to Dar Es Salaam Airport where it was to fly an ILS approach.The aircraft went into a spin and crashed. The pilot had lost control possibly due to attention being diverted to a no. 2 engine fire.
176,ACC677,"Two minutes after takeoff, at an altitude of 2040 m, the no. 3 engine suffered an uncontained failure. The no. 3 engine caught fire, but the flight engineer shut down engine no. 2. Some ten seconds later the engineer noticed the error and began attempts to restart engine no. 2. Meanwhile the crew was returning to the airport for an emergency landing. The no. 3 engine was then shut down and extinguishing bottles were fired. This was insufficient to put out the fire. Then the no. 2 engine suddenly spooled up to takeoff power. The engine power levers did not have any effect and the crew shut down the engine but the fuel valve was not closed.Meanwhile, the fire of the engine number 3 spread into the cavity of the pylon and the rear compartment where the APU was located. The fire continued to spread to engine no. 2. With one engine working the airplane passed the Outer Marker at an altitude of 175 m and a speed of 420 km/h.Because of fire damage to the electrical system, the Voltage dropped. The hydraulics failed and the airplane could no longer be controlled. It rolled right and descended at a rate of 10 m/sec. The airplane struck the ground in a 50 degree right bank, four minutes and 30 seconds after the start of the emergency.The reason for failure of engine no. 3 was a fatigue failure of the first stage low pressure compressor disk because of a metallurgical and manufacturing defect."
177,ACC678,"While on short final the aircraft was observed to nose down into the displaced threshold of runway 33L . The copilot stated that he sensed that he was getting slow and went to add power with his left hand. He was sitting for the first time in the left seat and although he had over 2400 total flight hrs, all but 2 hours of that were in aircraft that had the throttle control on the left. the pilot in command attempted to pull back on the yoke but the gear collapsed on touchdown and the aircraft bounced back up into the air before settling back down on the runway."
178,ACC679,"A lone male hijacked Eastern Airlines Flight 403 en route from Newark (EWR) to Miami (MIA) with 123 passengers and 9 crew members aboard. The hijacker emerged from the rear lavatory shouting in Spanish that he wanted to go to Cuba. The hijacker, holding a ""Bic"" type lighter in one hand and a bag in the other, told passengers and crew that he had poured gasoline on himself and the floor of the aircraft. He also claimed to have explosives inside the bag that he held inhis hand. The aircraft was diverted to Orlando, Florida and landed at approximately 01:14 a.m. The hijacker, believing he had landed in Cuba, dropped his bag and lighter, enabling the crew to overpower him. A subsequent investigation revealed that the hijacker's bag contained a folded newspaper and no evidence of any flammable liquid was found in the aircraft or on the hijacker's person. The hijacker reportedly wanted to return to Cuba to see his family."
179,ACC680,"The An-24 stalled and crashed while performing a missed approach in drizzle and fog.One flight attendant and two passengers, who were thrown away from the fuselage when the aircraft crashed onto the ground and disintegrated, survived the post-impact fire and explosion. CAAC Flight 5109 originated in Shanghai and was bound for Beijing with intermediate stops at Nanking and Jinan."
180,ACC681,"An Embraer 110P1 Bandeirante passenger plane, HK-2638, was destroyed in an accident near Buga, Colombia. All 15 passengers and two crew members were killed.AIRES Colombia flight 585 departed Florencia Airport (FLA) on a domestic flight to Cali Airport (CLO), Colombia. An intermediate stop was made at Neiva from were it took off at 09:35. The aircraft crashed into a mountain at 8600 feet after reporting at the Tulua VOR descending to FL105.This same day, ACES lost a DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft also due to VFR flight into IMC conditions."
181,ACC682,"The two ATP rated pilots were en route back to their home base airport flying on an IFR flight plan in actual instrument weather conditions. Communications with ATC controllers was normal. During a night localizer approach into Millville Airport, NJ (MIV), an ATC specialist observed the aircraft passing through the localizer track and issued a vector for re-interception. The aircraft was subsequently observed tracking inbound on course. The pilot reported crossing the OM. This was the last transmission heard from the pilot and was routine. The aircraft crashed into a wooded area just beyond the OM and was destroyed in a post impact fire. Post accident examination of the wreckage revealed evidence to indicate the left engine was producing less power than the right engine at impact."
182,ACC683,"During the take-off roll the aircraft did not achieve flying speed by the point where it was normally expected to become airborne. The pilot abandoned the take-off and applied maximum braking, but was unable to prevent the aircraft over-running the strip. The aircraft broke through the boundary fence and came to rest in a small ditch. The reason the aircraft did not achieve flying speed could not be positively determined. In this aircraft type, it is important that the elevator trim is correctly set for take-off. If nose-down trim is inadvertently applied, excessive rearward pressure is required on the control column in order to raise the nose. However, the trim position set by the pilot was not established. When the take-off attempt was abandoned, there was probably sufficient strip remaining to stop the aircraft. However, the brake linings and discs were worn to the extent where full brake effectiveness could not be obtained."
183,ACC684,"Four Shiite Muslims armed with automatic weapons stormed onto the apron at Beirut International Airport (BEY) in a car and commandeered a Cyprus Airways Boeing 707 aircraft. The aircraft was preparing for departure to Cyprus at the time of the seizure. The hijackers refused to allow passengers to board the aircraft but kept the nine member flight crew and three Lebanese employees of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, as hostages.The hijackers demanded the release of two Lebanese men jailed in Cyprus for the hijacking of a Libyan chartered Romanian airliner to Cyprus on June 23, 1983. The five hour ordeal ended when Cypriot authorities agreed to consider their demand. The crew and its aircraft later returned to Cyprus unharmed."
184,ACC685,"An Antonov 24B passenger plane, operated by Air Mali, was destroyed in an accident near Tombouctou Airport (TOM), Mali. There were 46 passengers and six crew members on board. One passenger survived the accident.The airplane operated on a flight from Gao Airport (GAQ) to Bamako Airport (BKO) with en route stops at Tombouctou and Mopti Airport (MZI).An engine failure after takeoff from Tombouctou, forced the crew to return. The aircraft crashed before being able to reach the airport."
185,ACC686,"Two Syrians being deported from West Germany to Syria hijacked a Lufthansa Boeing 727 shortly after departing Frankfurt, West Germany and forced the pilot to land at Vienna, Austria. Wielding knives and broken bottles, the hijackers demanded political asylum in Austria without being tried for air piracy. Afterapproximately two and a half hours of negotiations in Austria, the hijackers released all thirty-three passengers and kept the eight member crew hostage. After five hours of negotiations, the hijackers released the crew unharmed and surrendered to Austrian authorities."
186,ACC687,"The An-30 was used on an aerial photography flight in the Kabul area south of the Panjshir Valley. Upon returning to the airport, the no. 1 engine was struck my a Strela missile. The pilot attempted to land the plane at Bagram, but he was too high (800 m). While circling for landing the fire reached and destroyed the aileron controls. Control was lost. Three crew members managed to bail out safely."
187,ACC688,"The aircraft had to carry out a missed approach to a temporary winter landing strip and crashed in a steep nose down attitude, about 900 m past the runway end due to ice accretion (3/16 inch) on the wings. The de-ice boots were not used."
188,ACC689,The flaps retracted automatically during takeoff due to a short circuit. The aircraft started to descend after having reached a height of some 6-8 meters and came down in snow-covered terrain 250 metres behind the runway threshold at Borogon Airport.
189,ACC690,"On takeoff the no. 1 propeller lost a blade, causing the engine to be torn from its mounts. The takeoff was rejected. The left engine propeller had lost one blade which was found several days later 3000 feet west of the wreckage. There was no evidence found to substantiate compliance with a mandatory airworthiness directive on the propeller blade."
190,ACC691,"During taxi to takeoff the brakes failed. The pilot attempted to groundloop the aircraft, which rolled down hill and collided with a gully. During preflight the co-pilot inadvertently added hydraulic fluid in the alcohol tank. The hydraulic pump cavitated."
191,ACC692,"The Gulfstream I crashed after taking off from runway 20R when the no. 1 engine shut down. The left engine probably shut down because the left lever was found between the 'fuel off' and 'feather' positions, de-activating the autofeather system. The aircraft came to rest 100 feet past the runway end, 1720 feet left of the extended centreline.The aircraft crashed following the application of water-methanol."
192,ACC693,"While en route between Kobyai and Sangar, Russia, at an altitude of 550 m, the aircraft suffered a loss of engine power.The flight crew carried out in a forced landing in a swampy forest clearing.It appeared the engine had failed due to faulty repairs."
193,ACC694,"A lone male armed with a hand grenade hijacked a Middle East Airlines Boeing 707 aircraft moments before the aircraft landed at the Larnaca Airport, Cyprus. After landing, all passengers and 5 of the 10 crew members were allowed to deplane. The hijacker stated that he seized the aircraft in retaliation for the Royal Jordanian Airlines (ALIA) aircraft hijacking which occurred on June 11, 1985. The Palestinian hijacker initially demanded the release of the eight Jordanian air marshals who were aboard the hijacked ALIA aircraft. He was informed that the sky marshals were not in custody. Shortly thereafter, the hijacker agreed to end the hijacking. After giving up the hand grenade, the hijacker was allowed to board a nearby Royal Jordanian Airlines aircraft and was flown to Amman, Jordan where he was taken into custody by Jordanian authorities."
194,ACC695,"During an instrument approach, the right engine lost power. The pilot moved the right fuel selector to the left main tank and began emergency procedures. The aircraft broke out of the overcast and the aircrew saw the airport. However, the left engine also lost power. The captain noted the fuel pressure was dropping and elected to land on tundra beside a road. During the landing, the aircraft was substantially damaged. The aircraft was later reported at Salt Lake City March 1992 (condition not reported) and derelict at El Mirage, CA March 2000."
195,ACC696,Swerved off the runway after striking a bump near V1 speed. The aircraft collided with an embankment and caught fire.
196,ACC697,"Aeroflot flight 5143, a Tupolev Tu-154, departed Karshi (KSQ) on a flight to Leningrad (LED) via Ufa (UFA). The flight climbed to the cruising altitude of 11.600 m and maintained an airspeed of 400 km/h, which was close to stall speed under the given conditions. During cruise flight vibrations started because of the low airspeed. The crew assumed that the vibrations were caused by engine surges. They reduced power to flight idle, causing the airspeed to drop to 290 km/h. Trying to maintain altitude, the angle of attack increased until the airplane eventually stalled. The Tu-154 went into a flat spin and crashed."
197,ACC698,"After takeoff from Kandahar (KDH) the crew did not climb to a safe height, but instead continued immediately to Shindand. The An-12 was struck by a missile and crashed."
198,ACC699,"Delta Air Lines flight 191 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight between Fort Lauderdale, FL (FLL), and Los Angeles, CA (LAX), with an en route stop at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, TX (DFW). Flight 191, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar airplane, departed Fort Lauderdale on an IFR flight plan with 152 passengers and a crew of 11 on board at 15:10 EDT. The DFW Airport terminal weather forecast contained in the flightcrew's dispatch document package stated, in part, that there was a possibility of widely scattered rain showers and thunderstorms, becoming isolated after 20:00 CDT. The flight was uneventful until passing New Orleans, Louisiana. A line of weather along the Texas-Louisiana gulf coast had intensified. The flightcrew elected to change their route of flight to the more northerly Blue Ridge arrival route to avoid the developing weather to the south. This change necessitated a 10 to 15-minute hold at the Texarkana, Arkansas, VORTAC for arrival sequencing at the DFW Airport. At 17:35, the flightcrew received the following ATIS broadcast: ""DFW arrival information romeo, two one four seven Greenwich, weather six thousand scattered, two one thousand scattered, visibility one zero, temperature one zero one, dew point six seven, wind calm, altimeter two niner niner two, runway one eight right one seven left, visual approaches in progress, advise approach control that you have romeo"". Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) then cleared flight 191 to the Blue Ridge, Texas, VORTAC for the Blue Ridge Nine arrival, and to begin its descent. At 17:43:45, Fort Worth ARTCC cleared flight 191 to descend to 10,000 feet, gave it a 29.92 in Hg altimeter setting, and suggested that the flight turn to a heading-of 250 degrees ""to join the Blue Ridge zero one zero radial inbound and we have a good area there to go through.!' The captain replied that he was looking at a ""pretty good size"" weather cell, ""at a heading of two five five ... and I'd rather not go through it, I'd rather go around it one way or the other."" Fort Worth ARTCC then gave the flight another heading and stated ""when I can I'll turn you into Blue Ridge, it'll be about the zero one zero radial."" At 17:46, the center cleared flight 191 direct to Blue Ridge and to descend to 9,000 feet, and flight 191 acknowledged receipt of the clearance. At 17:48, the captain told the first officer, ""You're in good shape. I'm glad we didn't have to go through that mess. I thought sure he was going to send us through it."" Three minutes later, the flight engineer said, ""Looks like it's raining over Fort Worth."" At 17:51, Forth Worth ARTCC instructed flight 191 to contact DFW Airport Approach Control. At 17:56:28, Regional Approach Control's Feeder East controller transmitted an all aircraft message which was received by flight 191. The message stated in part, ""Attention, all aircraft listening... there's a little rainshower just north of the airport and they're starting to make ILS approaches ... tune up one oh nine one for one seven left."" At 17:59, the first officer stated, ""We're gonna get our airplane washed,"" and the captain switched to Regional Approach Control's Arrival Radar-1 (AR-1) frequency and told the controller that they were at 5,000 feet. At 18:00, the approach controller asked American Air Lines flight 351 if it was able to see the airport. (Flight 351 was two airplanes ahead of flight 191 in the landing sequence for runway 17L.) Flight 351 replied, ""As soon as we break out of this rainshower we will."" The controller then told flight 351 that it was 4 miles from the outer marker, and to join the localizer at 2,300 feet; the controller then cleared the flight for the ILS approach to runway 17L. At 18:00, the approach controller asked flight 191 to reduce its airspeed to 170 knots, and to turn left to 270 degrees; flight 191 then acknowledged receipt of the clearance. Flight 191 had been sequenced behind a Learjet 25 for landing on runway 17L. At 18:02, the approach controller told flight 191 that it was 6 miles from the outer marker, requested that it turn to 180 degrees to join the localizer at or above 2,300 feet, and stated, ""Cleared for ILS one seven left approach."" The flight acknowledged receipt of the transmission. At 18:03:03, the approach controller requested flight 191 ""to reduce your speed to one six zero please,"" and the captain replied, ""Be glad to."" Thereafter, at 18:03:30, he broadcast, ""And we're getting some variable winds out there due to a shower... out there north end of DFW."" This transmission was received by flight 191.At 18:03:46, the approach controller requested flight 191 to slow to 150 KIAS, and to contact the DFW Airport tower. At 18:03:58, the captain, after switching to the tower's radio frequency, stated, ""Tower, Delta one ninety one heavy, out here in the rain, feels good."" The tower cleared the flight to land and informed it, ""wind zero nine zero at five, gusts to one five."" At 18:04:07, the first officer called for the before-landing check. The flightcrew confirmed that the landing gear was down and that the flaps were extended to 33 degrees, the landing flap setting. At 18:04:18, the first officer said, ""Lightning coming out of that one."" The captain asked, ""What?"" and the first officer repeated ""Lightning coming out of that one."" The captain asked, and at 18:04:23, the first officer replied, ""Right ahead of us."" Flight 191 continued descending along the final approach course. At 18:05:05 the captain called out ""1,000 feet."" At 18:05:19, the captain cautioned the first officer to watch his indicated airspeed and a sound identified as rain began. The captain then warned the first officer, ""You're gonna lose it all of a sudden, there it is."" The captain stated, ""Push it up, push it way up."" At 18:05:29, the sound of engines at high rpm was heard on the CVR, and the captain said ""That's it."" At 18:05:44, the Ground Proximity Warning System's (GPWS) ""Whoop whoop pull up"" alert sounded and the captain commanded ""TOGA"". The CVR recording ended at 18:05:58. Witnesses on or near State Highway 114 north of the airport saw flight 191 emerge from the rain about 1.25 miles from the end of runway 17L and then strike an automobile in the westbound lane of State Highway 114. Subsequent investigation showed that the airplane had touched down earlier and became airborne again before striking the automobile. After the plane struck the car and a light pole on the highway, other witnesses saw fire on the left side of the airplane in the vicinity of the wing root. The witnesses generally agreed that the airplane struck the ground in a left-wing-low attitude, and that the fuselage rotated counterclockwise after the left wing and cockpit area struck a water tank on the airport. A large explosion obscured the witnesses' view momentarily, and then the tail section emerged from the fireball, skidding backwards. The tail section finally came to rest on its left side with the empennage pointing south and was subsequently blown to an upright position by wind gusts. One hundred and thirtyfour persons on board the airplane and the driver of the automobile which was struck by the airplane were killed in the accident; 27 persons on board the airplane and 1 rescue worker at the accident site were injured, 2 passengers on the airplane were uninjured."
199,ACC700,Descended into trees when on a night time instrument approach to Gulkana runway 14.
200,ACC701,Forced landing after engine failure. The aircraft bounced and ended up in swampy terrain.The engine control lever had disconnected due to faulty maintenance on final approach to Yunkor (Sartan).
201,ACC702,Shot down with a ground-to-air missile. The aircraft was flying at 3800 feet msl.
202,ACC703,"The aircraft departed Jenkinsburg on a skydiving flight. The engine lost power at approx 300 feet agl. and the Caravan then banked steeply left, spiralled in a steep nose down attitude and crashed. It appeared that the fuel in the tanks was contaminated with water and foreign material with the appearance of brown algae. A milky fluid (approx 65% jet fuel and 34% water) was found in the engine fuel control, as well as iron contaminants. Dark stringy material was found in the fuel filters. The aircraft had been refuelled from 55 gallon drums which contained contaminated fuel. The drums were stored upright and rain water could leak through the filler caps. N551CC had a history of fuel contamination which on occasions caused the fuel bypass indicator to display. Reportedly, the stall warning circuit breaker had been disengaged on other occasions, so as not to startle the jumpers; however, due to damage, its preimpact position could not be verified. The plane was estimated to be 370 lb (168 kg) over its maximum weight limit and 1 inch forward of the CG limit."
203,ACC704,"The Yak-40 should have climbed to 2400 m after takeoff, but was instructed to maintain 300 m because of an Antonov An-24 landing at a neighbouring airport. Bad weather was encountered when changing heading in an area of mountainous terrain. The aircraft collided with a mountain slope near Mikha-Tskhakaya.The aircraft operated on a flight from Tbilisi to Poti with en en route stop at Kutaisi."

206,ACC707,A total loss of power was experienced on takeoff from runway 18 due to the fuel selectors being in the off position. the pilot attempted to restart the engine during which time the aircraft entered a stall and collided with the terrain. According to passengers the pilot did not use a checklist nor were the passengers briefed before the flight.
207,ACC708,"A Uganda Airlines Fokker F-27 aircraft carrying 44 passengers and 4 crew members aboard was hijacked by two men while on a domestic flight from Entebbe Airport to Aura, Uganda. About one half hour after takeoff, the pilot radioed that a man with a gun had ordered him to divert. The aircraft landed at Kasese, Uganda, a stronghold of the National Resistance Army (NRA). The NRA is a rebel group which was fighting against the Ugandan regime. The passengers (except the hijackers) and crew were later released. The last group was released on or about December 17, 1985."
208,ACC709,"A Dassault Falcon 50 jet (N784B) and an Air Pegasus Piper PA-28-181 Archer (N1977H) collided about 1500 feet over the towns of Fairview and Cliffside Park, New Jersey, USA. The Falcon 50 was cleared for a standard instrument approach procedure in visual meteorological conditions and was in a left turn to position itself on the downwind leg to runway 19 at the Teterboro Airport, and the PA-28 was transiting the airport traffic area from west to east when they collided. The accident occurred 4 1/2 miles east-southeast at the edge of the airport traffic area in visual meteorological conditions. Both airplanes had been in radio contact with the Teterboro control tower. The flightcrew, the only occupants aboard the Falcon 50, and the pilot and two passengers onboard the PA-28 were killed. The Falcon 50 crashed into an apartment building killing one resident and seriously injuring two bystanders."
209,ACC710,"The Soviet An-12 transport plane was shot down by a South African special forces team with a ""Strela-1"" SAM. The missile hit engine no. 2 and the wing came off 47 seconds later. The aircraft crashed into a forest near Luassingua. All 8 crew and 13 passengers (Soviet military advisors and Angolan officers) were killed. The An-12 was en route from Cuito Cuanavale (CTI) to Luanda (LAD) via Menongue (SPP)."
210,ACC711,"While enroute, a lone armed man demanded the plane's course be changed. Reportedly, due to a lack of fuel, the plane landed in a pasture near Gannan, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China. The hijacker was taken into custody by Chinese authorities. The aircraft with 39 passengers and 4 crew was returned to the USSR."
211,ACC712,"The Shorts 360 aircraft was scheduled to fly from Dublin (DUB) to East Midlands Airport (EMA) as Aer Lingus flight 328. During the pre-flight briefing the crew learned that at East Midlands the precision radar was unserviceable and that, although the visual approach slope indicators (VASI) had been withdrawn, the precision approach path indicators (PAPI) were operational. The en-route weather was reported as being overcast for the whole journey, with cloud tops at FL70 and a probability of icing when flying in the cloud. There had also been a pilot's report of severe icing between FL30 and FL70 in the Birmingham area, some 30 nm south-west of East Midlands Airport. The terminal area forecast for East Midlands suggested a brisk north-easterly wind and a cloud base of 1200 feet.The aircraft took off at 17:25. The crew report that they exercised the wing and tail de-icing system during the climb to FL 90, the level which had been assigned for the flight, and that at that level they were above the layers of stratiform cloud. Following an uneventful flight, via Wallasey, to the NDB at Whitegate, they were taken under radar control directly towards the airport and given descent clearance, eventually to 3000 feet, to intercept the ILS approach path for runway 09. During the descent and before entering the cloud tops at about FL60, the crew switched on the aircraft's anti-ice system, which heats the windscreen, engine air intakes, propellers, static air vents and pitot probes but, in accordance with normal operating procedure, they did not use the wing and tail de-icing system. At this time, the freezing level (0°C isotherm) was at 1000 feet, the temperature at FL 60 was minus 6°C and the air was saturated. Whilst in the cloud, which according to the non-handling pilot was particularly dense, ice thrown from the propellers was heard striking the side of the aircraft fuselage, and it was suggested that the propeller rpm be increased to expedite the removal of the ice. Both pilots state that, at some time during the descent, they visually checked the aircraft for ice but saw none. Nevertheless, several other flights during that evening have since reported the occurrence of severe icing.Having levelled at 3000 feet, still in and out of cloud, the aircraft was directed by radar to intercept the ILS and was fully established on the glideslope and centreline by 10 nm, at which point the final descent was initiated. A normal approach was established and continued, past the outer marker beacon situated at 3.9 nm from touchdown, down to around 1000 feet above the runway threshold height. The crew state that up to this point they had neither experienced any significant turbulence nor observed any ice forming on the aircraft. The last meteorological information passed to the crew gave the wind as 060 degrees /15 kt, however, over the previous hour the wind speed in the area, although not automatically recorded at the airport, is reported as gusting up to 30 kt.As the aircraft descended through about 1000 feet, it suddenly rolled very sharply to the left without apparent cause. With the application of corrective aileron and rudder the aircraft rolled rapidly right, well beyond the wings level position. This alternate left and right rolling motion continued with the angles of bank increasing for some 30 seconds, causing the commander to believe that the aircraft might roll right over onto its back. The angles of bank then gradually decreased. During this period and the subsequent few seconds the aircraft established a very high descent rate approaching 3000 feet/min. Subsequently, with the aid of full engine power, the airspeed increased and the rate of descent was arrested just as the aircraft struck an 11 KV power cable.It continued through another similar cable, two of the supporting wooden poles and the tops of two trees, before coming to rest nose into a small wood edging a field of barley, some 460 metres from the impact with the first power cable. The cockpit and passenger cabin were relatively undamaged and there was no fire. The aircraft came to rest lying virtually upright and the passengers, and subsequently the crew, successfully evacuated from the front and rear emergency exits."
212,ACC713,"The brand-new Dash-8 passenger plane departed Sault Ste. Marie Airport on an IFR flight plan. The chief pilot, sitting in the left seat, was giving routine recurrent training to the first officer who was flying from the right seat. About 40 minutes after takeoff, the DHC-8 returned to the Sault Ste. Marie Airport to practise instrument approaches. For the final practice approach on runway 11, the crew decided to carry out a flapless ILS approach with a full-stop landing. As the aircraft intercepted the localizer on the inbound leg, the captain simulated a right engine fire. The captain then lowered the gear normally and the approach was continued on the glide slope and localizer with the left engine torque set at 30 per cent and the right engine torque (simulated failed) set at about 16 per cent. Both pitch levers were advanced to produce 1050 rpm. About 150 feet above the ground, the aircraft made an abrupt uncommanded roll to the right and began to lose altitude. The first officer applied full power to the left engine, and the captain, sensing an increasing sink rate, applied power to the right engine as well. However, the aircraft continued to lose altitude rapidly, and it struck the snow-covered ground short of the runway in a 12-degree nose-up attitude, heading 128 degrees in a 24-degree right-wing-low attitude. The right wing tip hit the ground first, followed by the tail of the fuselage, the right main gear, and the right nacelle. The aircraft bounced about 15 feet and then touched down on the still intact left main gear. The nose gear broke off, and the aircraft bounced another 50 feet forward before sliding to a stop. The tail cone, nose gear and right propeller spinner were found along the wreckage trail. All four propeller blades from the right engine separated from the hub during the crash sequence."
213,ACC714,Belly landed after the crew forgot to lower the landing gear.
214,ACC715,"Delta Flight 139, a TriStar with 211 passengers and 11 crew, was taxiing towards the terminal at Dallas Ft.-Worth International Airport when a male passenger ran to the forward cabin area from the back of the aircraft, grabbed a male flight attendant, and placed a pocket-knife with a 3-inch blade to his throat. The passenger had boarded the aircraft at Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, after going through normal preboard screening. The man stated that he was hijacking the aircraft and demanded access to the cockpit. He also claimed to have a hand grenade. During the first hours of negotiations, he allowed all the passengers to deplane and demanded that he be provided police protection for himself and his family from what he described as ""Mafia hit men."" He never said where he wanted the aircraft to go. After about two hours of negotiations, the flight-attendant being held by the hijacker managed to escape from his grasp and he was overpowered by FBI agents. No grenade or explosive device was found. He was arrested and charged with air piracy and interference with a flight crewmember but was subsequently found not guilty by reason of insanity. There were no injuries during the hijacking."
215,ACC716,"During a night takeoff from Saransk the captain mistook red lights on the localizer and inner marker beacon for the anti-collision lights of an oncoming aircraft and took violent evasive action. The aircraft lost altitude and collided with the ground, breaking up on impact.The aircraft operated on a flight from Nizhnevartovsk to Sverdlovsk, Saransk and Gomel."
216,ACC717,"The Ilyushin Il-14M operated on a flight from the Molodezhnaya Ice Station to the Mirny Ice Station in Antarctica in support of the the 31st Soviet Antarctic Expedition. The estimated flight time was 7 hours and 45 minutes. The aircraft was equipped with skis and additional fuel tanks were located in the cabin.In the second half of the route, the crew got into severe icing conditions, which was not foreseen by the forecast, and was forced to reduce the flight altitude. Having descended to a level of 1500 m, the crew fell into the zone of a jet stream with hurricane force head winds (up to 140 km/h). This led to a decrease in ground speed and a shortage of fuel to reach the destination. At a distance of more than 200 km from Mirny station, the plane entered white out conditions with reduced visibility of almost zero.At 06:50 Moscow time, the crew reported that the remaining fuel was for 30 minutes of flight. At 07:05 it was decided to perform an emergency landing on a glacier. Due to the weather conditions it was impossible to determine the vertical distance to the glacier surface and its condition. Under these conditions the aircraft collided with the surface of the glacier. All occupants were killed."

220,ACC721,"A wheel/ski-equipped DHC-3 Otter aircraft was on the return leg of a charter flight to Snegamook Lake to retrieve a hunting party of four, along with their hunting gear and bounty of several hundred ptarmigan. It departed Snegamook Lake at 09:15. After takeoff, the engine began to run rough but improved somewhat when the power was reduced for cruising. As the aircraft was approaching Nipishish Lake, the pilot reported to company dispatch that the engine was again running rough, but he was able to maintain altitude, and he would follow the Crooked River toward Goose Bay in case a precautionary landing became necessary. Three minutes later, C-FAGM called dispatch again, advising them that he was intending to land on a large area on the Crooked River. He also indicated that there was an odour of smoke in the aircraft. The aircraft was in a nose-down, left- bank attitude, with the flaps fully extended and the skis retracted when it struck the frozen surface of the river. The Otter bounced clear of the surface, turned left came to rest in an upright position."

227,ACC728,"Pacific Western Airlines Flight 117 departed Calgary at 19:42 on a scheduled IFR flight to Vancouver with an en route stop at Kelowna. The first officer, who was pilot flying, climbed to the en route altitude of FL310. Descent clearance was obtained and at 20:10, the captain contacted Kelowna ATC. The tower controller advised the flight that runway 33 was in use, surface winds were 300 degrees at .15 to 20 knots with occasional gusts to 25, and torrential rain and gusty winds associated with a storm cell that was moving toward the airport from the northwest were present. On the descent, the aircraft broke out of cloud prior to reaching the minimum en route altitude (MEA), and the descent was continued visually. The crew sighted the airport, observed that the storm had moved to the east away from the airport, and decided not to hold at the NDB but to continue with the approach. The aircraft was levelled at 5,500 feet asl and passed to the west of the airport about 4,000 feet asl. At 20:21 a left descending turn was commenced onto the final approach path. The captain transmitted the aircraft's position to ATC and was advised that the flight was cleared to land, the surface winds were 030 degrees at 10 knots, and the runway was very wet. The pre-landing checks were completed, and a visual approach was conducted in light rain. The planned threshold speed was 125 knots adjusted to 135 knots to allow for the wind conditions at the airport. As the aircraft was flared for touchdown, it was subjected to a gust of wind. The landing was very smooth, between 1,500 and 1,800 feet down the runway at a speed of 135 knots. After touchdown, the first officer retarded the thrust levers, applied the brakes, and attempted to select reverse thrust. When the first officer was unable to move the thrust levers into the reverse position, he advised the captain who also tried unsuccessfully. The captain also applied full brakes. Braking was ineffective, and, with the end of the runway rapidly approaching, the captain shut down the engines. The aircraft left the end of the runway and came to rest approximately 1,300 feet beyond the end of the runway, 90 feet to the left of the extended centre line."
228,ACC729,Takeoff attempted on wrong runway. Takeoff was aborted but the Lear overran the runway and hit a stone wall. The aircraft was destroyed by fire.
229,ACC730,"The aircraft pitched up, rolled inverted and crashed left of Texarkana runway 13. It appeared that the aircraft had been loaded with the center-of-gravity (cg) well behind the aft limit. Also, the aircraft had been weighed on Sept. 8, 1984 and later on Feb. 1, 1986, weight & balance data had been recomputed after removal of a radar and an autopilot, but an error had been made during the weight and balance preparation. Subsequently, the aircraft was operated in a tail heavy condition. Tests showed the pilot and co-pilot had alcohol levels of 0.044% and 0.171%, respectively."
230,ACC731,"PanAm flight PA73 was a scheduled service between Bombay, India and New York-JFK Airport, USA, with intermediate stop at Karachi, Pakistan and Frankfurt, West Germany.During the stopover at Karachi, as passengers boarded the aircraft for the flight, a van that had been modified to look like an airport security vehicle, drove through a security checkpoint up to one of the boarding stairways of the aircraft. Four hijackers stormed up the stairways into the plane, fired shots from an automatic weapon and seized control of the aircraft. Flight attendants were able to alert the cockpit crew using intercom, allowing the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer to escape through a hatch in the cockpit. During the following 16 hours, Zayd Hassan Safarini, the Jordanian leader of the hijackers, demanded the return of the flight crew to fly the aircraft to Larnaca, Cyprus, where he wanted to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners being detained in Cyprus. During negotiations between Safarini and Pakistani authorities, Safarini threatened to kill all passengers. Four hours into the hijacking, one of the passengers was shot and pushed out the door onto the tarmac below. As nightfall arrived, the hijackers herded the passengers and crew members into the center section of the aircraft. The four hijackers opened fire on the passengers and crew, and threw grenades among them, killing almost 20. Most of the survivors escaped through two doors of the plane which were opened when the firing began.Pakistani special forces commando's then stormed the plane and arrested the hijackers."
231,ACC732,"An Aeroflot Tupolev 134 was on the ground at Ufa on a scheduled stop en route from Kiev to Nizhnevartovsk in western Siberia. Two armed men, reportedly fleeing from the police, opened fire as they tried to seize the aircraft and shot two passengers to death before both were fatally shot by security forces. Earlier the two men allegedly killed two policemen who tried to pursue them after they had commandeered a taxi and forced the driver to take them to the airport."
232,ACC733,"The co-pilot was carrying out the takeoff when the flight crew spotted a large bird on the right side and, when travelling at 150 knots, another large bird on the centreline. The aircraft was rotated to 5-8 degrees when a loud sound on the right hand side was followed by severe vibration. The captain took over the controls and aborted the takeoff. The aircraft couldn't be stopped on the runway and overran."
233,ACC734,"The Tupolev Tu-134 departed Mbala (MMQ), Zambia, for a flight back to Maputo (MPM). The flight carried Mozambique president Samora Machel who had attended a meeting of African leaders in Zambia. While approaching Maputo, an inadvertent selection of the MATSAPA VOR frequency caused the crew to execute a premature 37-degrees turn. Although the pilot queried the turn, no effort was made to verify it by using the available navigational aids. The aircraft descended below the 3000 feet limit in spite of not having visual contact with Maputo. The crew erroneously assumed a power failure at Maputo.A 32-second GPWS warning was ignored and the aircraft collided with the ground at 2187 feet, bounced and crashed into an uphill slope. The aircraft broke up, slid across the South African/Eswatini border and caught fire. Machel, along with 33 other occupants did not survive the accident."
234,ACC735,"A Shorts SC.7 Skyvan 3-200 sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at Nightmute, AK.According to the pilot-in-command, when the aircraft was on final approach to the 1600 ft runway, it encountered a downdraft. Subsequently, the aircraft hit hard on the lip of the runway, then bounced and touched down on the runway. After the second touchdown, the aircraft veered to the right, exited the runway and continued onto open tundra. The aircraft's right main gear, right wing, right prop and nose gear were damaged during the sequence."
235,ACC736,"The aircraft undershot runway 35 during a night time approach, impacted the edge of a ditch, broke up and eventually came to rest inverted. The co-pilot, who was under route check, let the aircraft descend below the MDA of 400 feet. The pilot was distracted from monitoring the height because he was attempting to talk to the co-pilot into correcting the approach."
236,ACC737,The pilots lost aileron control shortly after takeoff while in a left turn. The left turning tendencies of the aircraft could not be corrected and the aircraft crash landed in the Caribbean Sea. Post crash inspection of the aircraft revealed the left aileron control cable was trapped within a bundle of electrical wires and cables. This occurred when an electrical cable from a reverse current relay in the right wing to the main junction box in the left cabin area at the center wing was changed and secured. The aileron cable chafed through the protective cover of the large electrical cable. When contact was made with the metal electrical cable the aileron cable arched at several points and separated at two different points causing a loss of aileron control.
237,ACC738,"The C-130, carrying seven crew members and 96 soldiers, flew into a mountain while on approach to Zahedan. The crew had descended below the minimum safety altitude of 6500 feet.Most of the soldiers were from the 88th Armoured Division of Zahedan."
238,ACC739,"At 06:12 Piper PA-23 Apache N2185P took off from Pine Shadows. The pilot, an Eastern Airlines DC-9 captain had to check in at Tampa at 07:20 to command Flight 164 from Tampa to Newark. Weather at Tampa was worsening and RVR at touchdown of 600 feet, midpoint and rollout 800 feet was reported to the Apache pilot. Though the Apache is classified as approach category A (min. RVR 1800 feet), the ILS approach to runway 36L was continued. At 06:47 the Apache pilot reported he was executing a missed approach.At 06:58 the aircraft was cleared for a second approach with RVR at touchdown reported 600 feet, 1000 feet midpoint and 800 feet at rollout. RVR midpoint later deteriorated to 800 feet. At the same time, a Pan American Boeing 727-235 (N4743) was cleared to taxi to runway 36L via taxiway W at 07:01. While passing taxiway W-2 the 727 crewmembers saw the Apache coming out of the fog on a head-on collision course. The Apache pitched up and banked slightly to the left The no. 1 engine struck the 727's lower nose area and separated. The Apache passed under the wing and skidded another 100 feet and caught fire. The Boeing was evacuated."
239,ACC740,"The An-12 took off from Kabul, carrying several tons of S-24 rockets and 400 kilograms of explosives to Jalalabad. While climbing to an altitude of 6400 m the aircraft was struck by a Stinger missile and crashed."
240,ACC741,"During arrival for a LOC runway 26 approach, the pilot was advised the abyss fan marker was notamed out-of-service. With abyss inoperative, the minimum descent altitude (MDA) was 2200 feet. After N65TD was cleared for the approach, radar service was terminated and the flight was cleared to advisory frequency. The crew contacted unicom and obtained airport and weather advisory. The Unicom operator advised winds light and variable, estimated 800 feet overcast, visibility 5 miles, slush and ice reported on runway 1/2 hr earlier. After the crew reported 'procedure turn inbound,' no further transmissions were received from the aircraft. Subsequently, it hit trees on rising terrain at an elevation of approx 2200 feet, approx 7 miles before reaching the final approach fix (FAF, DALTON NDB). Minimum altitude for the approach in that area was 3000 feet. No preimpact part problems were found during the investigation. Airport elevation was 1194 feet. Radio transcripts indicated the crew were getting a weak signal from the DALTON NDB. Although not a required navaid, CHESTER VORTAC was depicted on the approach chart as an additional source to id the FAF, but was notamed as out-of-svc. The pilot did not obtain notams before flight."
241,ACC742,The aircraft suffered an uncontrollable no. 3 engine fire and ditched in the Pacific Ocean.
242,ACC743,"At 500 feet on approach to Nadi the right flap jammed at 35° while the left one continued to 60°. The aircraft rolled to 90° bank, struck the ground and cart wheeled short of runway 21.PROBABLE CAUSE: Unsecured non-standard flap attachment pin migrated upward and lodged in a lightening hole."
243,ACC744,"The Islander ditched off Pilas Island following engine problems. Three occupants were rescued, two bodies were found and the remaining seven were reported missing."

245,ACC746,"The Metro collided with a Mooney 20 (N6485U) at 7000 feet, while the Metro was on a runway 34 approach. Both airplanes fell to the ground with the wreckage scattered over 2sq miles in a residential area."
246,ACC747,"The BMA Fokker F-27 aircraft was engaged on crew training at East Midlands Airport (EMA). The commander, who was an experienced training captain, occupied the right pilot's seat and a first officer undergoing training for conversion to captaincy occupied the left seat as handling pilot. Another captain refreshing on type sat on the jump seat behind the pilots' seats, the intention being that he should move into the left seat after the first officer's training period. The weather was: wind 150 degrees at 7 kts, visibility 4 km and cloud 7 oktas stratus, base 1000 feet. The surface temperature was 2 °C and the QNH 1030.The training session began with a practice abandoned takeoff after which the aircraft took off at 13:08 and flew three practice ILS approaches followed by touch-and-go landings on runway 09, climbing to 2000 feet above mean sea level (amsl) after each takeoff. The runway in use was then changed and the aircraft flew a simulated asymmetric ILS approach to runway 27 followed by a missed approach (go-around) with the left engine throttled back. The runway was then changed again and an ILS approach to runway 09 was flown with the left engine still throttled back. This approach was followed by a touch-and-go landing during which both engines were brought up to full power. Very soon after becoming airborne the training captain again simulated failure of the left engine and the aircraft was climbed to 2000 feet amsl. Soon after the aircraft levelled off, the handling pilot commented on the large amount of rudder required to counteract the simulated failure of the left engine after takeoff. The training captain then said that he was deliberately putting more drag on the left side than would have been the case if the propeller had auto-feathered so that the climb performance corresponded better with that of an aircraft with passengers on board. He went on to say that if the handling pilot could cope with that extra drag, he could expect to control the aircraft if the failed engine auto-feathered because the rudder pedal force would then not be quite so great. The crew then began a procedural NDB approach to runway 09, for which instrument screens were fitted in front of the handling pilot. It was intended that the aircraft should be landed after the NDB approach for the pilot in the jump seat to take over as handling pilot. Decision altitude for the approach was 740 feet and touchdown altitude was 305 feet. It was company practice for beacon passage to be identified by the movement of the radio compass needle and, as the aircraft passed about one third of a mile north of the marker beacon inbound, descending through approximately 1300 feet amsl, the handling pilot said ""Over the beacon now"". No audio signal from the marker beacon was heard on the cockpit voice recorder. The landing checklist was completed during the following 20 seconds, including confirmation that the undercarriage was down, fuel heaters were off, two blue propeller lights were illuminated and fuel was trimmed up. 48 seconds after passing the beacon the aircraft reached decision altitude, and the training captain asked the handling pilot ""How long and where is it?"", to which the handling pilot replied ""Got about a minute and ten seconds to go - should be straight in front"". 22 seconds later and some 36 seconds before impact the training captain said ""Why are we at 650 feet?"" and pointed out that the handling pilot had allowed the aircraft to descend below decision altitude when he was, for training purposes, still in IMC. The handling pilot responded by saying ""Intend going around then"", or words to that effect. The training captain then said ""Yes, well I'll let you see it now. There it is"". As the training captain was saying this, the sound of an engine power increase was heard on the CVR, and, about 25 seconds before impact, the rpm of one engine was increased to 14,800 rpm, a setting 200 rpm below maximum continuous power. 10 seconds later the training captain was heard to say ""Hang on, that's the - that's the field there. See it?"" The handling pilot then said ""Hold tight"", at which point, some 13 seconds before impact, the CVR recorded the sound of another engine increasing power to 14,800 rpm. A moment later the handling pilot said ""Haven't got it"", and the training captain said ""I've got it"". The F-27 yawed to the left before banking steeply to the right. The aircraft struck the ground on the northern side of the Castle Donington motor racing circuit in a nose-down attitude, banked to the left and with considerable left sideslip. After the accident an accumulation of mixed rime and glaze ice was found on the leading edges of the wings and tail surfaces which had formed rough-surfaced horns one inch high above and below the airflow stagnation point. No ice was found on the flaps or landing gear."
247,ACC748,"An Antonov 26 transport plane was shot down by Afghan Mujahideen guerrillas.The guerrillas claimed that 15 Afghan officers, 22 soldiers and six crew members were killed in the crash. The government said that the plane was carrying 30 civilians and six crew members."
248,ACC749,The Stratotanker caught fire during landing rollout and burned out. At the time of the explosion the copilot was making a radio transmission using the UHF radio. The UHF wire which runs near the aft wing root in the fuselage was melted due to an electrical fault. Fuel vapors in the area of the aft body tank were ignited. Three firefighters who responded to the accident were also injured.
249,ACC750,"The flight was uneventful during takeoff and climb to an assigned cruise altitude of FL260. Approximately 40 minutes after takeoff the number 3 engine experienced an uncontained failure of the turbine blades on the number 4 power turbine wheel. Although debris from the engine penetrated the pressure vessel, the pilot made an unscheduled landing at Fresno Airport, California without further incident. Examination of the engine revealed that ferrous chips were contaminating, and oil was bypassing the engine oil filter for at least 40 days. However, no corrective action was taken by company maintenance personnel. The oil and filter were changed three times in the three months previous to the accident. The examination revealed that the contaminated oil contributed to the failure of the number four turbine bearing subsequently leading to overheating and damage to the overspeed sensors. The turbine oversped and the turbine blades departed the turbine disc."
250,ACC751,"Alaska Airlines Flight 93, a Boeing 727, was en route from Seattle to Anchorage with 102 passengers and 7 crew members when a passenger, a Cuban refugee, handed a note to a flight attendant which indicated he wanted to go to Cuba.Simulating possession of a weapon with his hand in his pocket, he started up the aisle shouting ""Cuba, Cuba."" He gained access to the cockpit when the door was inadvertently opened but was quickly overpowered by the crew. The hijacker was tied up while the flight continued on to Anchorage. He was taken into custody and later charged with air piracy. There were no injuries."
251,ACC752,Two Soviet Air Force Ilyushin 76's (CCCP-76679 and CCCP-76685) were practising a formation flight at night. Due to a navigational error both aircraft collided and crashed into Lake Sivash.

253,ACC754,"Gear up landing; the HS-748 slid to stop beside the runway, 1075 m from threshold. PROBABLE CAUSE: The co-pilot, performing the landing, forgot to use checklist and thus to extend the gear."
254,ACC755,"Douglas DC-3C C-FADD was returning to Pickle Lake from Big Trout Lake following delivery of a cargo of fuel. This was the third similar and last operation of the day. As the aircraft approached Pickle Lake, the pilot informed the company dispatch office that, prior to landing, he intended to carry out some local training for the benefit of the co-pilot who was scheduled to be upgraded to captain status the following month. The captain, a company training pilot, occupied the right seat. The aircraft entered a west to east holding pattern at the airport's NDB, descending in stages from 8,500 feet asl to 2,700 feet asl, the appropriate altitude for an instrument approach. The pilot transmitted that they would execute an NDB approach and subsequently reported during the procedure turn inbound to the airfield. About three minutes later, two other pilots flying in the vicinity observed the aircraft in a descent with the left wing folded upwards. The aircraft continued descending in an inverted attitude until it struck the ground."
255,ACC756,"The airplane was destabilized by a slight vertical air movement on approach. The pilot touched the airplane down short of the runway, collapsing the landing gear before sliding off the strip into adjacent tundra.The aircraft was chartered to fly in supplies to rebuild a school at Shageluk, which had been destroyed by a fire. After the accident, the aircraft was bought by a local for $1. The fuselage is since in use as a workshop."
256,ACC757,"Air New Zealand Flight 24, a Boeing 747, was undergoing a pre-flight check by its crew when an airline customer services supervisor entered the cockpit and threatened the crew with explosives. He demanded the aircraft take on extra fuel and ordered that it be flown to Libya, although other reports suggest he wanted to go to New Zealand. All passengers were released but he held the three flight crew members for nearly six hours while he negotiated with authorities. The hijacker was overpowered and taken into custody after one of the crew struck him on the head with a whiskey bottle. The hijacking attempt was apparently related to a political coup on Fiji one week earlier."
257,ACC758,Crashed into a ravine.
258,ACC759,Shot down by a rebel missile. Rebels claimed they brought down a military Ilyushin 14.
259,ACC760,The aircraft undershot the runway and the right main gear struck the runway edge. The wing then failed.The DC-4 was on a flight from Kasba Bay to Hidden Bay.
260,ACC761,"The Fokker F-27 flew into a 8200 feet mountain, about 15 minutes after leaving Heho."
261,ACC762,"The F-27 sustained substantial damage when the nose landing gear collapsed in a runway excursion accident.The aircraft encountered heavy rain while overhead the airport. Visibility decreased, so the pilot circled five times over the field for weather to improve.Upon landing the aircraft ran off the runway, bogging down in soft soil."
262,ACC763,"A Britten-Norman BN-2A-27 Islander sustained minor damage in a ground accident at Sabadell Airport, Spain. The pilot was not injured.The airplane struck a stationary Bell 206B helicopter (EC-ECT) when manoeuvring on the platform."
263,ACC764,"While on an instrument flight plan in IMC, the flight was cleared for an instrument approach to the South Lake Tahoe Airport, the intended destination. The aircraft departed the initial approach fix on the published transition to the final approach course. Radar contact was lost at 11,400 feet. Afterward, the aircraft was observed descending out of clouds and manoeuvring erratically in VMC until it impacted terrain with no apparent attempt to recover. Medical records revealed pilot had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent loss of 41 pounds on a rigid weight loss program. The autopsy revealed severe arteriosclorosis. Medical records indicated the pilot had been taking diazide intermittently for several years. Post-accident tox results were negative. The circumstances of the accident, in combination with the pilot's severe diet, medical history, and postmortem examination results support the conclusion that the pilot became incapacitated in flight."
264,ACC765,"The aircraft crashed due to loss of lift, caused by sawdust frozen on top of the wings."
265,ACC766,"The left engine failed during initial climb immediately after lift-off. Airspeed could not be maintained a.o. because the aircraft was loaded to 3,809 pounds above its maximum allowable takeoff gross weight. An emergency landing was attempted but directional control was lost and the aircraft stalled/mushed and collided with the terrain alongside the runway."
266,ACC767,"During an approach in gusty winds, the pilot noted a right cross-wind. He stated that after touchdown, the roll-out was stabilized for a short distance, then the right wing began to lift. He applied full aileron and rudder to maintain control, but was unable to stop on the remaining runway. The aircraft continued off an embankment at the departure end of the runway and was damaged."
267,ACC768,"Thai Airways Flight 365 was approaching Phuket VOR/DME on radial 119 after a flight from Hat Yai. At the same time Dragon Air Flight 203 (a Boeing 737 registered VR-HYL, carrying 62 occupants) also approached Phuket VOR/DME on radial 090. At 08:34 UTC Dragonair 203 reported at 2500 feet with Thai 365 in sight in front of them. The Thai Boeing was flying at 3000 feet at the time, and was 13 miles from Phuket VOR/DME. Dragonair 203, first priority in approach sequence, then turned right at 12 DME and was going to turn inbound for finals for runway 27. The Thai crew surmised that the other crew were making a false position report to gain landing priority and reported hurriedly that they were at 8 DME inbound and requested visual approach, though they hadn't reached 8 DME yet. This forced Phuket Approach to give Thai 365 landing priority at 08:35. The Dragonair crew (flying IFR) immediately warned that the Thai plane couldn't descend through their flight level. Concentrating on the conflicting traffic the speed decayed to 163 knots until the stick shaker activated. The Thai crew then applied power and raised the landing gear, but the aircraft entered a stall crashed into the sea, disintegrating on impact."
268,ACC769,"Crashed immediately after takeoff.One of the occupants was Marcos de Barros Freire, Brazilian minister of Agrarian Reform."
269,ACC770,"The Airbus touched down 700 m past the runway threshold. The right main gear hit runway lights and the aircraft collided with an antenna and fences. End of June 1987, the aircraft had totalled 9200 cycles and 20.600 flying hours."
270,ACC771,The aircraft collided with the ILS glide slope antenna tower during a simulated engine failure takeoff from runway 07. The flaps were extended at or below the 50deg setting. The wingtip separated and the aircraft crashed out of control.

272,ACC773,"The Volpar Turboliner II cargo plane took off from Memphis International Airport, TN (MEM), bound for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport, KY (CVG). After takeoff the pilot was told by the Tower controller that the tail stand, used to prevent aircraft from tipping on tail when loaded, was still attached to the aircraft. The pilot requested a teardrop turn back to the departure runway. The aircraft was returning to runway 36R when it stalled. Recovery was attempted but the aircraft impacted the ground prior to completion of level off. The aircraft was 379 lb over maximum takeoff weight and cg was at least 3 inch forward of the limit. No record of a load manifest was found. The pilot in command had low PIC experience and received 2.7 documented flight hours with the operator's instructor pilot including his 135 competency check ride of 1.1 hours. The operator's initial training certification showed 5 hours of flight training. The aircraft, a Volpar Turboliner II cargo plane, was a stretched turbine conversion of a Beechcraft SNB-5 Navigator (Redesignated TC-45J in 1962) that was operated by the US Navy."
273,ACC774,"The Dassault Falcon 20D, EC-EFI, had been acquired by Spanish operator Drenair. The airplane was prepared at West Palm Beach, Florida for a ferry flight to Europe. The aircraft flew to Bedford, Massachusetts and Goose Bay, Canada. From there the aircraft planned to cross the Atlantic via Keflavík, Iceland.En route to Keflavík, the aircraft encountered extreme head winds, causing the fuel to be exhausted before the aircraft was able to reach Iceland. A ditched was carried out and all occupants were rescued by a helicopter."

275,ACC776,"Crashed into hilltop while on a localizer-DME approach to runway 14 at Leeds/Bradford Airport (LBA) in low cloud conditions.The laid down descent angle for a Localiser/DME approach to runway 14 at Leeds/Bradford Airport is 3.5°. Whereas a standard 3 degree descent angle can readily be calculated and flown by a pilot using a formula of 300 feet per nautical mile, it is more difficult, particularly in single pilot operations, to calculate and achieve a 3.5° descent. An aircraft on a 3.5° approach angle, on a pressure setting of 998 mb, would pass approximately 100 feet above the accident site but, a 3° approach would result in ground contact in the area of the site."
276,ACC777,Visibility was poor as the An-12 attempted to take off for Tashkent. The aircraft collided with a Mil Mi-24 helicopter on the runway.
277,ACC778,"During the approach at night, the An-26 was struck by a Stinger missile and crashed."
278,ACC779,"While cruising in IMC the pilot encountered moderate to severe turbulence near an area where weather cells could have been observed on the aircraft's radar. The pilot reversed course, declared an emergency and lost control of the aircraft. The aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent, collided with terrain and was destroyed. It was reported that the newly hired pilot did not understand the Caravan's weather radar (nor was she required to by operator or FAA)."
279,ACC780,"The Islander broke up in flight and crashed. The pilot who was hired to ferry the plane told the ferry company he was an experienced Islander pilot, but no previous Islander flight time was found in the pilot's logbook."
280,ACC781,"The DHC-4A Caribou aircraft was en route from Calgary to Ross River where it was to be used to transport silver ore concentrate from the mines at Plata to Ross River. On board were two pilots, two company aircraft maintenance engineers to service the aircraft, and about 5,500 pounds of aircraft parts and equipment to support the operation of the aircraft in Ross River. One refuelling stop was made at Fort Nelson, after which the aircraft proceeded on an IFR flight plan to its destination. Ross River has no published instrument approach and is situated in a valley in mountainous terrain. It was necessary to overfly Ross River, proceed 30 miles to the northwest and complete an NDB approach at Faro where the minimum circling altitude is 2,709 feet agl. When below cloud at Faro, the aircraft must then proceed visually up the river valley to Ross River. The Caribou arrived over Faro at approximately 16:15, and an attempt was made to descend below the cloud base which was reported to be 400 to 600 feet agl. When visual reference with the ground was not made, the pilot climbed out to the southeast and informed Faro Community Airport Radio Station (CARS) that he was proceeding to his alternate, Watson Lake. In cruise flight the no. 2 engine began to lose oil, causing the oil pressure to drop to zero. The right engine was then shut down, and the propeller was feathered. A little later, the aircraft was heard flying out to the southeast for an approach to runway 26 at the Ross River Airport. On approach the landing gear had to be recycled because the nose gear did not lock down during the first attempt to lower the gear. The plane was no longer in a position to land, so the captain initiated a go-around. The aircraft passed by the town and then began to lose altitude, descending gradually into the trees. Portions of the right wing were torn off on contact with the trees, and the plane rolled to the right and nosed into the ground. The aircraft then cartwheeled over the embankment and down onto the river shore 20 feet below."
281,ACC782,"While enroute to home base after delivery of revenue cargo, the pilot experienced a total loss of engine power in both engines due to fuel exhaustion. The pilot performed emergency procedures and set the aircraft up for a forced landing in a grassy field on the edge of a lake. The aircraft initially impacted a tree and the rocky berm of the shoreline. The contact with the berm caused the landing gear to break off, the aircraft swerved around and skidded backwards before coming to a rest about 150 feet from the lakeshore. Post accident investigation revealed less than 2 gallons of fuel in each wing tank.The aircraft, a Volpar Turboliner II cargo plane, was a stretched turbine conversion of a Beechcraft SNB-5 Navigator (Redesignated TC-45J in 1962) that was operated by the US Navy."
282,ACC783,"Flight 103 was fully loaded (all 19 seats occupied; 1437 pounds of cargo) when it took off from Kodiak runway 07. The aircraft lifted off the runway, fell back and accelerated for about another 15 knots before it became airborne. The aircraft was approaching Homer at 18:19 when it was cleared for the localizer/DME approach to runway 3. The crew reported a 2-mile final 5 minutes later. On short final the wings were seen to rock back and forth; the aircraft then dropped steeply to the ground in a rather flat attitude, struck the airport perimeter fence and slid to a stop on its belly."
283,ACC784,"Cessna Caravan ZK-SFB was one of two Caravans being used for cargo flights between Wellington (WLG) and Christchurch (CHC). The pilot on one of these flights had worked for 18 hours before the accident, had loaded and unloaded by hand some ten tons of freight and was soaked by rain while doing so because no foul weather gear was provided. Also he did not have a proper meal break before the flight and was eating sweets to sustain himself. After departure the aircraft climbed to an altitude of 11000 feet. Since the pilot had no oxygen indoctrination course, he would have been mildly hypoxic. Around midnight the aircraft encountered severe icing. The aircraft had no airframe de-icing equipment and the airspeed dropped until it stalled. The Caravan entered a spin and crashed into the sea off the Kaikoura Coast."
284,ACC785,"It appears that the wreckage of this crash has never been located. It is, however, believed that the plane went down in the vicinity of Mount Waddington. The death certificates for the four men aboard the plane list Mount Waddington as the place of death."
285,ACC786,"A British Aerospace BAe-146-200 passenger jet, registered N350PS, was destroyed when it impacted the ground near Paso Robles, CA. All five crew members and 38 passengers on board were killed. Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 hade departed Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX) on a domestic flight to San Francisco International Airport, CA (SFO).A recently discharged USAir employee boarded the flight after bypassing security. He carried a borrowed 44 caliber pistol. His former supervisor was on board the flight. At 16:13, the pilot reported to Oakland ARTCC that he had an emergency and that gunshots had been fired in the airplane. Within 25 seconds, Oakland CTR controllers observed that PSA1771 had begun a rapid descent from which it did not recover. Witnesses on the ground said the airplane was intact and there was no evidence of fire before the airplane struck the ground in a steep nose-down attitude. The cvr tape revealed the sounds of a scuffle and several shots which were apparently fired in or near the cockpit. The pistol was found in the wreckage with 6 expended rounds. FAA rules permitted airline employees to bypass security checkpoints."
286,ACC787,Ditched following a loss of engine power during a test flight.
287,ACC788,"While circling to a safe height after takeoff, the An-26 was hit by a Stinger missile. The no. 1 engine was hit and shrapnel punctured the fuel tank. Smoke entered the cabin. All of the crew members bailed out safely except for the pilot. He jumped out at an altitude too low to open the parachute."
288,ACC789,"Crashed during an ILS approach in a slight noseup, slight right wing down attitude, with a high vertical rate of descent, and a high forward speed. The copilot was not rated in the aircraft and had logged a total of 7.9 of jet time in his logbook."
289,ACC790,"Prior to a scheduled 07:20 departure, the flight and cabin crew of Delta flight 1490 completed their pre-flight duties and checks. The first officer would act as the pilot flying during the flight to Spokane. Before-start checks were completed without incident. Delta Flight 1490 received its IFR clearance to Spokane, and, at 07:18, the aircraft was instructed to taxi to runway 08 and to await takeoff clearance. At 07:28, Flight 1490 was cleared to take off and to contact Departure Control after takeoff. The initial takeoff roll was uneventful until the airspeed reached between 100 and 110 knots. At that time, the flight crew heard a loud bang, and the aircraft veered slightly to the left. The takeoff was rejected, and the aircraft was brought to taxiing speed as it approached taxiway Whiskey. ATC personnel then queried Flight 1490 about the presence of smoke on the left side of the aircraft. After confirming with the captain that the left engine had failed, the first officer shut down the engine and activated the left engine fire extinguisher system. The aircraft was taxied off the 200-foot-wide runway onto taxiway Whiskey, where it was brought to an immediate stop. The captain then ordered an emergency evacuation on the right side of the aircraft."
290,ACC791,Struck high ground on approach.
291,ACC792,"The DC-6, operated by Nicaraguan rebel forces, was dropping military supply and food when it was shot down by government forces.The aircraft had completed dropping 11 loads of weapons, food, ammunition and clothing, each weighing about 800 pounds. The first ground-fired missile struck one of the engines on the right hand wing but the plane continued flying for some 20 miles. It was then struck by a second missile and four minutes later crashed."
292,ACC793,"The no.1 and no. 3 engines rpm dropped on takeoff. The no. 2 engine rpm also dropped, but recovered. The no. 1 and no. 3 engines eventually shut down, causing the aircraft to lose speed. The plane stalled, collided with obstacles and broke up.PROBABLE CAUSE: Reduction in engine thrust during takeoff, probably because the crew closed the throttle."
293,ACC794,"The Swearingen Metro III, operating NFD flight 108, was destroyed when it impacted terrain near Kettwig, Germany, following a lightning strike. All 21 on board were killed.Scheduled departure time from Hannover Airport, Germany was 07:00 hours. However, due to snow fall during the night, the flight crew decided to de-ice the airplane prior to departure. The flight took off at 07:15 hours, bound for Düsseldorf. The climb to FL140 was uneventful. Just prior to descent the flight crew noticed a thunderstorm conditions in the area. Descent was commenced at 07:39. Eight minutes later the aircraft was cleared down to 3000 feet, and the controller reported that flight 108 was number three on approach.At 07:49 the controller warned no. 2 on approach that a previous aircraft had reported a lightning strike on final approach. He offered to vector the flight around the area. The offer was declined. At 07:50 the controller warned flight 108 as well: ""Flamingo 108 the same information for you, the preceding landing experienced a lightning strike on about 6 miles final"". The crew answered: ""we copied and are looking outside"".At 07:50:50 NFD flight 108 captured the localizer at an altitude of 2900 ft. The crew saw on the weather radar that the area with the thunderstorm activity was right in front of them. At 07:54:25 flight 108 flew into the thunderstorm.The first officer pointed out to the pilot in command, who was flying, that they were to the left of the approach course and asked him to turn to the right. The pilot in command replied that he did not necessarily want to fly ""in there"", but he changed course to return to the centreline. The flight crew then switched to the Düsseldorf Tower controller. There was no more contact with the flight. The aircraft entered s steep descent. Eyewitnesses on the ground saw the aircraft descending through the clouds and then pull up again, disappearing into the clouds. The aircraft became uncontrollable and broke up in flight."
294,ACC795,"Four Tanzanian youths (17-20 years old) hijacked the airplane attempting to find a better life abroad. They demanded to be flown to London via Addis Ababa.The captain led the hijackers to believe that a refueling stop at Lodwar Airport, Kenya was necessary. The crew then fooled the hijackers by returning to Dar Es Salaam. The aircraft landed in darkness. The following morning the hijackers realized that they were back at Dar Es Salaam and wounded the crew using a knife.They attempted to flee the plane but were arrested by troops that had surrounded the aircraft. It appeared that their guns and hand grenade were fake."
295,ACC796,"During a non-standard approach in IMC a course reciprocal to clearance was flown. Visual contact was lost and the aircraft descended through decision height. The aircraft landed rough beside the runway, broke up and caught fire."
296,ACC797,"One passenger brandished a gun and entered the cockpit. He demanded to be taken to Kabul, Afghanistan. He was overpowered by a security guard and one of the flight crew members."
297,ACC798,An engine caught fire on the second takeoff attempt. The aircraft crashed at the runway end.
298,ACC799,A fire was discovered on board at FL90 and the aircraft returned. The descent rate increased and the aircraft struck the ground in a 45° angle. The fuel source was a leak under pressure from the right hand fuel booster pump or its adjacent plumbing.
299,ACC800,A no. 2 engine power loss on climbout forced the crew to return to the airport. A massive fire in the engine nacelle was discovered after lowering the gear. The airplane departed runway 16L on emergency landing and struck ground equipment before crashing into jetways B7 and B9.
300,ACC801,Struck a hill in bad weather during a flight from Muya to Bagdarin.The flight crew deviated from the established route and descended prematurely below the safe altitude.
301,ACC802,"The purpose of the training flight was to practice takeoffs and landings at night without the use of aircraft lights. After landing, the crew made a decision to perform an unscheduled take-off and for this purpose sharply pushed the throttle from 0° to maximum. Before the aircraft took off, the propeller of the right engine was feathered, which the crew did not notice in time and continued takeoff. Having discovered the auto-shutdown of the engine at an altitude of 70 m and a speed of 200 km/h, the crew made three failed attempts to start the auxiliary power unit. Contrary to the requirements of the Airplane Flight Manual, the crew began to start the starboard engine at an unacceptably low altitude and speed. The plane stalled, touched the roof of a two-storey country house, fell into a small pond, collapsed and partially burned down. The disaster occurred at a distance of 15 km from the Chkalovsky airfield."
302,ACC803,"On April 28, 1988, an Aloha Airline Boeing 737, N73711, was scheduled for a series of interisland flights in Hawaii. The crew flew three uneventful roundtrip flights, one each from Honolulu to Hilo (ITO), Kahului Airport, HI (OGG) on the island of Maui, and Kauai Island Airport (LIH). At 11:00, a scheduled first officer change took place for the remainder of the day. The crew flew from Honolulu to Maui and then from Maui to Hilo. At 13:25, flight 243 departed Hilo Airport en route to Honolulu. The first officer conducted the takeoff and en route climb to FL240 in VMC. As the airplane leveled at 24,000 feet, both pilots heard a loud ""clap"" or ""whooshing"" sound followed by a wind noise behind them. The first officer's head was jerked backward, and she stated that debris, including pieces of gray insulation, was floating in the cockpit. The captain observed that the cockpit entry door was missing and that ""there was blue sky where the first-class ceiling had been."" The captain immediately took over the controls of the airplane. He described the airplane attitude as rolling slightly left and right and that the flight controls felt ""loose."" Because of the decompression, both pilots and the air traffic controller in the observer seat donned their oxygen masks. The captain began an emergency descent. He stated that he extended the speed brakes and descended at an indicated airspeed (IAS) of 280 to 290 knots. Because of ambient noise, the pilots initially used hand signals to communicate. The first officer stated that she observed a rate of descent of 4,100 feet per minute at some point during the emergency descent. The captain also stated that he actuated the passenger oxygen switch. The passenger oxygen manual tee handle was not actuated. When the decompression occurred, all the passengers were seated and the seat belt sign was illuminated. The No. 1 flight attendant reportedly was standing at seat row 5. According to passenger observations, the flight attendant was immediately swept out of the cabin through a hole in the left side of the fuselage. The No. 2 flight attendant, standing by row 15/16, was thrown to the floor and sustained minor bruises. She was subsequently able to crawl up and down the aisle to render assistance and calm the passengers. The No. 3 flight attendant, standing at row 2, was struck in the head by debris and thrown to the floor. She suffered serious injuries. The first officer tuned the transponder to emergency code 7700 and attempted to notify Honolulu Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) that the flight was diverting to Maui. Because of the cockpit noise level, she could not hear any radio transmissions, and she was not sure if the Honolulu ARTCC heard the communication. Although Honolulu ARTCC did not receive the first officer's initial communication, the controller working flight 243 observed an emergency code 7700 transponder return about 23 nautical miles south-southeast of the Kahalui Airport, Maui. Starting at 13:48:15, the controller attempted to communicate with the flight several times without success.When the airplane descended through 14,000 feet, the first officer switched the radio to the Maui Tower frequency. At 13:48:35, she informed the tower of the rapid decompression, declared an emergency, and stated the need for emergency equipment. The local controller instructed flight 243 to change to the Maui Sector transponder code to identify the flight and indicate to surrounding air traffic control (ATC) facilities that the flight was being handled by the Maui ATC facility. The first officer changed the transponder as requested. At 13:50:58, the local controller requested the flight to switch frequencies to approach control because the flight was outside radar coverage for the local controller. Although the request was acknowledged, Flight 243 continued to transmit on the local controller frequency. At 13:53:44, the first officer informed the local controller, ""We're going to need assistance. We cannot communicate with the flight attendants. We'll need assistance for the passengers when we land."" An ambulance request was not initiated as a result of this radio call. The captain stated that he began slowing the airplane as the flight approached 10,000 feet msl. He retracted the speed brakes, removed his oxygen mask, and began a gradual turn toward Maui's runway 02. At 210 knots IAS, the flightcrew could communicate verbally. Initially flaps 1 were selected, then flaps 5. When attempting to extend beyond flaps 5, the airplane became less controllable, and the captain decided to return to flaps 5 for the landing. Because the captain found the airplane becoming less controllable below 170 knots IAS, he elected to use 170 knots IAS for the approach and landing. Using the public address (PA) system and on-board interphone, the first officer attempted to communicate with the flight attendants; however, there was no response. At the command of the captain, the first officer lowered the landing gear at the normal point in the approach pattern. The main gear indicated down and locked; however, the nose gear position indicator light did not illuminate. Manual nose gear extension was selected and still the green indicator light did not illuminate; however, the red landing gear unsafe indicator light was not illuminated. After another manual attempt, the handle was placed down to complete the manual gear extension procedure. The captain said no attempt was made to use the nose gear downlock viewer because the center jumpseat was occupied and the captain believed it was urgent to land the airplane immediately. At 13:55:05, the first officer advised the tower, ""We won't have a nose gear,"" and at 13:56:14, the crew advised the tower, ""We'll need all the equipment you've got."" While advancing the power levers to maneuver for the approach, the captain sensed a yawing motion and determined that the No.1 (left) engine had failed. At 170 to 200 knots IAS, he placed the No. 1 engine start switch to the ""flight"" position in an attempt to start the engine; there was no response. A normal descent profile was established 4 miles out on the final approach. The captain said that the airplane was ""shaking a little, rocking slightly and felt springy."" Flight 243 landed on runway 02 at Maui's Kahului Airport at 13:58:45. The captain said that he was able to make a normal touchdown and landing rollout. He used the No. 2 engine thrust reverser and brakes to stop the airplane. During the latter part of the rollout, the flaps were extended to 40° as required for an evacuation. An emergency evacuation was then accomplished on the runway."
303,ACC804,"Widerøe flight 710 took off from Trondheim (TRD), Norway, at 19:23 local time on a domestic light to Namsos (OSY), Brønnøysund (BNN), Sandnessjøen (SSJ) and Bodø Airport (BOO).The flight to Namsos was uneventful. The aircraft took off from Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim ACC six minutes later, stating that they were climbing from FL70 to FL90. At 20:20 the crew began their descent for Brønnøysund and switched frequencies to Brønnøysund AFIS.Weather reported at Brønnøysund was: wind 220°/05 kts, visibility 9 km, 3/8 stratus at 600 feet and 6/8 at 1000 feet, temperature +6 C, QNH 1022 MB.The crew executed a VOR/DME approach to Brønnøysund's runway 04, followed by a circle for landing on runway 22. The crew left the prescribed altitude 4 NM early. The aircraft descended until it flew into the Torghatten hillside at 560 feet.A retired police officer reported in July 2013 that a passenger had taken a mobile phone on board. The police officer disembarked the plane at Namsos, a stop-over and reported that the passenger with the mobile phone was seated in the cockpits jump-seat.After the accident, he reported this fact to the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC). After reading the investigation report during the 25th anniversary of the accident, he noticed that there was no mention of the mobile phone.NMT 450 network-based mobiles at the time were fitted with a 15-watt transmitter and a powerful battery which could lead to disruption in electronic equipment.The Norwegian AIB conducted an investigation to determine if electronic interference from the mobile phone might have affected the flight instruments. The AIB concluded that there was no evidence to support the theory that there was any kind of interference."
304,ACC805,"The crew of American Flight 70 rejected the takeoff when the slat disagree light illuminated and the takeoff warning horn sounded at 166 knots (V1), but the aircraft accelerated to 178 knots ground speed before it began to decelerate. The deceleration was normal until 130 knots where an unexpected rapid decay in the deceleration occurred. The aircraft ran off the end of the runway at 95 knots, the nose gear collapsed, and the aircraft came to a stop 1,100 feet beyond the end of the runway. Eight of the ten brake sets failed. Post-accident examination of the brakes revealed that excessive brake wear occurred during the rejected takeoff. Testing showed that DC-10 worn brakes have a much greater wear rate during a rejected takeoff. The FAA did not require worn brake testing. Douglas did not use brake wear data from rto certification tests to set more conservative brake wear replacement limits. New brakes were used for those tests."
305,ACC806,"The Learjet departed with several discrepancies and with two unauthorized passengers on board, one was the co-pilot's wife. The aircraft climbed to and levelled at 1900 feet. The plane rolled inverted, and struck the terrain in 80 degrees nose down, wings level attitude and heading opposite to direction of flight, very near the co-pilot's home. The copilot was new to jet operations."
306,ACC807,"The F-27 took off from Billund for a flight to Nürnberg via Hannover. The crew were performing an ADF approach to Hannover runway 09R.When the flaps were fully extended, the aircraft pitched up violently. The cargo shift back during power change for a go around. Flaps were set at 11deg instead of 26deg."
307,ACC808,"The C-130, assigned to the 189th Airlift Wing at Little Rock AFB, crashed short of the runway during a training flight. This was the fourth five-hour training flight of two trainee pilots.The plane made two instrument approaches to Greenville Airport and then six visual approaches using a standard landing pattern just before the crash. The plane landed on the sixth approach, turned around on the runway and departed, and crashed about 1.5 miles from the threshold while approaching for a seventh visual landing.Witnesses said the plane banked right to get on final approach, appeared to overshoot and then banked hard left. It hit the ground with the left wing banked over about 40 degrees, with the nose down about 30 degrees. It was traveling about 85 knots or 90 knots at the time of impact."
308,ACC809,"On a flight from Rovno to Vladimirets th An-2 encountered a thunderstorm of which the crew had not been warned of by ATC. The engine flamed out due to rain ingestion, forcing the crew to carry out a forced landing. The aircraft force-landed in a wooded area near Aleksandriya village (Rovno region)."
309,ACC810,"Austral Lineas Aéreas flight 046 departed Buenos Aires-Aeroparque Jorge Newbery at 07:04 hours local time on a domestic flight to Resistencia and Posadas, Argentina. The first leg of the flight uneventful and the DC-9-81 aircraft departed Resistencia at 08:40 hours following a 26-minute stopover. At 09:09, the crew established radio contact with the Posadas Tower controller, reporting at FL 090, VMC, at 30 NM from the airport. Some 7 minutes later the controller cleared the flight for a runway 01 VOR/DME approach, requesting the crew to report over the VOR, and cleared the flight to descend to 4000 feet. Weather at that time was very poor, with about 100 m visibility in fog. At 09:20 the aircraft struck the top of a eucalyptus forest, at 3022 m (1,63 NM) from the runway 01 threshold."
310,ACC811,Collided with terrain in an attempt to locate clear weather.
311,ACC812,Descended fast on final approach. Application of full power couldn't prevent the aircraft from impacting the ground short of the runway.
312,ACC813,"Vayudoot flight 125 from Bhopal, India, touched down normally at Guna Airport. After rolling 750 feet, the aircraft moved to the left and ran off the side of the runway. It entered kutcha and hit a flower bed. The nose landing gear folded and dragged for about 55 feet. There was no fire."
313,ACC814,The aircraft ground looped on landing and ran off the runway. The undercarriage collapsed.
314,ACC815,The An-26 crashed at Kabul after being shot at (small arms fire) by mujahedin rebels.
315,ACC816,"A newly delivered Airbus A320, F-GFKC, was destroyed when it impacted trees during a low pass over the runway at Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport, France. A fire broke out, killing three occupants.The Mulhouse Flying Club had requested Air France to perform a fly by at their air show at Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport on June 26, 1988.Air France prepared a low speed pass with the gear down at 100 feet and the another pass at high speed in clean configuration. While Air France had performed more than twenty low passes since 1987, the altitude of 100 feet was not allowed according to regulations. French air safety regulations imposed a minimum VFR overflight height of 170 feet.The fly by was to be performed using an Airbus A320, an aircraft model that was introduced by launching customer Air France in March 1988. F-GFKC was the third A320 in the fleet and had been delivered on June 23.The flight crew scheduled to perform the demonstration flight were two captains: the head of A320 training subdivision (Pilot Flying) and a captain participating in the placing into service of the A320(Pilot Monitoring).On board the flight were four cabin crew members and 130 passengers.The aircraft took off from nearby Basle-Mulhouse Airport at 14:41 and climbed to 1000 feet agl. The crew started the descent three minutes later and Habsheim was in sight at 450 feet agl. The Pilot Monitoring informed the Pilot Flying that the aircraft was reaching 100 feet at 14:45:14. The descent continued to 50 feet 8 seconds later and further to 30-35 feet. Go-around power was added at 14:45:35. The A320 continued and touched trees approximately 60 meters from the end of runway 34R at 14:45:40 with a 14 degree pitch attitude and engines at 83% N1. The plane sank slowly into the forest and a fire broke out."
316,ACC817,"Iran Air flight 451 arrived at Bandar Abbas (BND) from Tehran (THR) at 08:40. The Airbus A300 was to continue to Dubai (DXB) as flight 655. Prior to departure the crew received an enroute clearance to Dubai via the flight planned route A59 and A59W at FL140. The flight took off from runway 21 at 10:17 hours and climbed straight ahead.Two minutes later, the crew reported leaving 3500 feet for FL140 on Airway A59, estimating MOBET at 06:53 UTC (10:23 Iran time). At 10:24:00 the aircraft passed MOBET out of FL120. At 10:24:43 the Airbus was hit by surface-to-air missiles. The tail and one wing broke off as a result of the explosions. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed into the sea. The missiles were fired by the US Navy cruiser USS Vincennes. It was operating in the area together with the frigates USS Elmer Montgommery and USS John H. Sides. They were to protect other ships in the area.At about the time the Airbus took off, the radar aboard the USS Vincennes picked up a brief IFF mode 2 response, which led to the mistaken identification of the Airbus as a hostile F-14 aircraft. The USS Vincennes issued 7 challenges on the Military Air Distress (MAD) frequency 243 MHz, addressed to 'Iranian aircraft', 'Iranian fighter' or 'Iranian F-14'. These messages were followed by three challenges on the IAD (International Air Defence) radio frequency. Due to increasing tension in the area - on May 17, 1987 an Iraqi Mirage had attacked USS Stark - all aircraft in the area had to monitor 121.5 Mhz: the International Air Defence - IAD radio frequency. There was no response. Meanwhile radar operators were monitoring the Aegis screens. They reported that the incoming plane was descending with an increasing speed. In fact, the Airbus was climbing. Considering itself and USS Montgomery under aggression, USS Vincennes took the ultimate decision to launch missiles against the perceived hostile target at 10:24:22.It remains uncertain whether the IR655 flight crew (only able to monitor the IAD, not the MAD frequencies) would have been able to rapidly identify their flight as the subject of the challenges made by the USS Vincennes."
317,ACC818,Crashed during engine-out landing following a test flight.
318,ACC819,"The Boeing 737-200 aircraft impacted a bull while landing at Vadodara Airport (BDQ), India. The aircraft then developed a tendency to swing to the left. This tendency could not be countered and the aircraft ran off the runway onto kutcha, coming to rest 5000 feet from the beginning of the runway. There was no fire."
319,ACC820,"During the taxi to the runway, the flight crew noted a vibration in the airplane and stopped to check the tires, thinking that they were under inflated. No obvious problem was seen, and they elected to takeoff. Shortly after takeoff, a fire erupted in the left main gear wheel well. The pilot returned to the airport and landed safely. However, the airplane sustained extensive damage to the left wing and aileron control system. Examination of the brakes revealed a cocked thermal insulator in the piston bore. There was evidence that the brakes were worn, had been dragging, then overheated; and that the tires had exploded prior to the fire. The fire damage indicated that the fire had started near the brakes. An aluminum fitting was used as part of the hydraulic brake system on the steel brake housing. The examination indicated that the fitting had been installed but could not be found after the fire. The crew said that they delayed lowering the gear, in contradiction to the checklist requirement when the wheel well and wing overheat light is on."
320,ACC821,"After landing at the aircraft's manufacturer facility at Tucson with an asymmetric fuel condition and an inoperative yaw damper, the crew elected to continue the flight to their destination without correcting the deficiencies. Enroute to Chino, California, the captain informed air traffic controllers that he had fuel coming from one tank and that he doubted that had fuel available to reach his destination. The controller cleared the aircraft to land at a nearby airport, Riverside-March Air Force Bay. As the aircraft turned onto the final approach for runway 32 it rolled inverted and impacted the ground inverted."
321,ACC822,"The CASA 212 was bought by Geoterrex in 1983 and registered in Canada in 1985. The plane had been extensively modified for aerial survey work. These modifications consisted of two probes mounted on the fuselage above the cockpit and extending 10 feet in front of the aircraft nose, a l6-foot tail boom, and two wing tip pylons. The probes, pylons, and tail boom served to support a wire loop antenna which ran around the aircraft. In July 1988 the plane was prepared for a ferry flight across the Atlantic to Nantes, France. For the purposes of this ferry trip, the survey loop antenna and the wing tip pylons had been removed and stowed in the main cabin area. For this configuration a special ferry permit was necessary, but the company did not apply for one. On July 31, 1988 the aircraft departed Ottawa and arrived at Goose Bay later that day. On 2 August 1988, the aircraft departed Goose Bay at 09:05 UTC and arrived at Narsarsuaq, Greenland at 12:50 UTC. The aircraft was refuelled and departed one hour later at 13:50 UTC for Reykjavik, Iceland, at a planned altitude of FL130. Although the pilots instrument rating had expired and the co-pilot did not possess one, the crew filed an IFR flight plan to Reykjavik. The weight of the aircraft was about 3,000 pounds above the maximum authorized takeoff weight on takeoff from Narsarsuaq. At Reykjavik, the crew flew an ILS approach to runway 20. During the approach, the flaps were set at approximately 25 degrees, 15 degrees above the approved maximum of 10 degrees. Approximately one-half mile from the runway threshold, the aircraft entered a steep turn to the right, and the nose of the aircraft dropped sharply. The aircraft continued to turn to the right through 270 degrees and descended rapidly until it struck the ground approximately 900 feet short of the runway threshold. The aircraft burst into flames shortly after impact."
322,ACC823,"A Pakistan Air Force Lockheed C-130B Hercules carrying Pakistani President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq crashed shortly after takeoff from Bahawalpur Airport and caught fire. All 30 occupants were killed.Zia-ul-Haq had witnessed a tank inspection at Bahawalpur and was returning to Islamabad with his entourage, which consisted a.o. of several senior army generals and the American Ambassador to Pakistan.Many theories indicated that the accident was caused by sabotage. In 2008 newspaper The Times reported that, back in 1988, an analysis by a US lab found ""extensive contamination"" by brass and aluminium particles in the elevator booster package. This may have caused sluggish controls leading to overcontrol. This in turn may have led to the pilots losing control at low altitude soon after takeoff."
323,ACC824,"The flight crew failed to set the altimeters to aerodrome setting during the approach in poor weather. The aircraft descended into trees on the slope of a mountain (at 700 m altitude), broke up and caught fire. Crew duty time had exceeded 15 hours when the crash happened."
324,ACC825,"The An-2 operated on a survey flight out of Zhigansk, patrolling along the Lena River in order to identify sources of pollution along the route.The flight was carried out over the river Lena at a height of 100 m with an occasional descent to 50 m for the inspection of vessels. On the way back to Zhigansk the captain ordered the copilot to make a preliminary calculations of the next flight to Sangar. Thus the copilot did not actively monitor the position of the aircraft."
325,ACC826,"Missing en route between Villavicencio and Neiva, Colombia. The airplane had just been delivered following conversion to an AC-47 gunship."
326,ACC827,"Flight DL1141 (Jackson - Dallas - Salt Lake City) left Gate 15 at 08:30 and was instructed to taxi to runway 18L. When first in line for takeoff (at 08:59) the flight was cleared for takeoff. The takeoff was uneventful until the airplane reached the rotation phase (at 154 knots, 6017 feet down the runway). As the main gear wheels left the ground, the airplane began to roll violently, causing the right wingtip to contact the runway (1033 feet after lift-off), followed by compressor surges. The plane continued and struck the ILS localizer antenna array 1000 feet past the end of runway 18L. After impacting the antenna installation, the airplane remained airborne for an additional 400 feet, then struck the ground, traversed a ground depression and slid sideways until it came to rest near the airport perimeter fence, 3200 feet from the runway end. Parts of the aircraft had separated in the slide and a fire had erupted in the right wing area, quickly engulfing the rear, right side of the airplane after it came to rest."
327,ACC828,Weather was poor as the airplane flew into the side of a mountain in the Sierra Madre.
328,ACC829,"The pilot encountered low ceilings, rain and fog while attempting to fly through a narrow mountain pass and successfully reversed course. He then flew into a small canyon off the main pass that terminated in a small glacier-covered bowl surrounded by steep rock walls. When it became apparent during a turn to reverse course that there was insufficient space to complete the maneuver before collision with a rock wall, the pilot retarded the throttles and crash landed on a glacier."
329,ACC830,"The pilot and his two passengers had just arrived at the Jackson Hole Airport, WY (JAC) approximately 30 minutes prior to the accident. The pilot dropped off his passengers and stepped into operations for a short break. He then returned to the aircraft by himself for a return flight to Redding Airport, CA (RDD). It was a very dark night with a 2000 ft overcast and no visible horizon. The pilot had departed Redding, CA at 13:57 hours and had been on continuous flight duty from that time until the time of the accident. A witness stated the pilot seemed to be tired and hungry. The aircraft was observed making a normal night takeoff. Witnesses stated that as the aircraft turned from crosswind to downwind it appeared that the pilot had trouble controlling the aircraft. After the aircraft made a few extreme up and down manoeuvres, it appeared to proceed to the east. The next time the aircraft was observed, it was again climbing and descending rapidly and subsequently impacted the ground in a vertical dive."
330,ACC831,"Ethiopian Airlines flight 604, a Boeing 737-200, was a scheduled service from Addis Ababa to Bahar Dar and Asmara. The first leg of the flight was uneventful. At 09:50, the engines were started normally and the airplane was taxied to its take-off position. The flight crew reported that In order to gain additional thrust they elected not to use engine bleed air during take-off. The airplane accelerated at a normal rate during the take-off roll and passed V1 (take-off-reject) speed. As the airplane passed V1 and very near VR (rotation speed) the flightcrew saw a flock of pigeons lifting up from the left side. At this time the captain took over control from the copilot and pulled up. Almost immediately after rotation, the airplanestruck the flock of pigeons at an airspeed of 146 knots and altitude of 5730 feet above mean sea level. Loud bangs were heard.The captain then called for gear up and the copilot complied. At approximately 100-200 ft. above the ground, both engines started backfiring. At this time, the flight crew reported that they experienced a considerable power loss and the airplane started mushing down at which time the captain ""fire walled"" the thrust levers. The engines reportedly responded and the airplane began to gain some altitude. The gain in attitude encouraged the captain to make a right turn away from Lake Tana and back to the take-off runway for landing.During the initial 32 seconds after the impact, the airplane had gained altitude from 5,730 feet to 6,020 feet and had accelerated from 146 knots to 154 knots.The crew report further indicated that both engines continued to surge and the exhaust gas temperature gauges (EGT) were reading at the top extreme and the engine pressure ratio (EPR) gauge readings were fluctuating at about 1.6. During this time the captain reported that the he reduced engine thrust to prolong the operational life of the engines. The frequency of the surges decreased with engines power reduction. The airplane entered an approximate 90 degree right turn. Altitude remained constant 6,020 feet while its airspeed increased from 154 knots to 162 knots. The airplane then began another right turn and entered the downwind leg of the return to runway 04. Altitude had increased to 6,410 feet and airspeed to 173 knots. On the downwind leg the aircraft further climbed to 7,100 feet. Then, within a timeframe of about five seconds, both engines lost power completely.The copilot pointed out a cleared area slightly ahead and to the right. The captain then turned towards the clearing and performed a gear-up landing. The aircraft broke up and a fire erupted.Out of the 104 occupants, 35 suffered fatal injuries."
331,ACC832,"Aerolineas Argentinas Flight 648 departed Buenos Aires-Aeroparque for a flight to Ushuaia with intermediate stops at Bahía Blanca and Rio Grande.At 11:20 the flight contacted Ushuaia reporting over Fagnano at FL120, requesting clearance to leave FL120. The flight was cleared down to 8000 feet and weather was reported being wind 230deg at 12 knots, runway 16 in use, visibility 30 km, 3/8 SC at 1200 meters, 2/8 CU at 1500, temperature 9deg C QNH 998,4 mb. After passing 8000 feet the aircraft was cleared to descend for runway 16 in VMC. Because latest reports indicated wind from 360deg at 20 knots the crew decided to use runway 34 instead. They were warned of possible windshear for that approach. At 11:36 the aircraft touched down hard (1.89G) with excessive speed (140 knots instead of 128 kts) bounced and the Boeing then veered off and went down a slope into 2 m deep water."
332,ACC833,The flight approached Batagay (situated in mountainous area) at night. The crew decided to use a track that is allowed only for visual approaches. Intentional deviation from the approved procedure caused the GPWS to sound. The GPWS was switched off and the An-12 eventually collided with a mountain at 537 metres above the runway level.
333,ACC834,"An Ilyushin Il-14 was engaged in a sightseeing flight over the Linfen area. All passengers were employees of a local knitting factory. The aircraft was originally equipped with 14 seats but the airline allowed 44 passengers to board the plane. At 13:20 hours the aircraft took off from the local air base. Shortly after takeoff the aircraft lost height and the left wing hit a building, causing part of the wing to separate. The aircraft then hit eight poplars and impacted the roof of a hotel. Just four passengers survived the accident; 40 passengers, four crew and two pedestrians died.It was determined that the left engine had failed following a fatigue fracture in the engine's oil pump drive shaft."
334,ACC835,"A Douglas DC-3C was destroyed when it crashed in Pikangikum Lake, ON, Canada. Both the pilot and the co-pilot were fatally injured in the accident.The airplane departed Red Lake Airport, ON (YRL) as Air Ontario flight 937 on a flight to Pikangikum Airport, ON (YPM). The main cargo load being carried consisted of a rubberized bladder tank containing 2,068 litres of fuel oil.Weather at the Pikangikum Airport was poor with drizzle, low clouds, and fog, with a visibility of one and one-half to two miles. The airplane was heard overflying the airport and turning over the Pikangikum Lake in preparation for a final approach and landing on runway 27. While over the water the airplane stalled and struck the ice-covered lake 180 feet south of a tree-covered island. It descended through the ice and struck the lake bottom at a depth of 8 to 12 feet. The ice thickness at the area of impact varied from one inch to three inches."
335,ACC836,"In cruise the right engine failed and the propeller feathered automatically. During descent for a precautionary landing, power was restored but the engine stopped again. At 6000 ft the left engine failed. The pilot force landed wheels-up on a nearby field.It appeared the fuel system of the aircraft was contaminated."
336,ACC837,"An Antonov An-26 transport aircraft of the Afghan Air Force, crashed near Parachinar, Pakistan. All on board were killed.According to Afghanistan officials the Antonov, with 25 passengers and 5 crew members on board, suffered mechanical problems and crossed the border with Pakistan. Pakistani officials stated that the airplane failed to identify itself. Conflicting reports indicate the aircraft was either shot down by surface-to-air missiles or by a Pakistani General Dynamics F-16A jet.Conflicting news reports indicated 27, 30 or 34 fatalities."
337,ACC838,"The air ambulance Beechcraft A100 King Air, Voyageur 796, with two flight crew members and two paramedics on board, departed Timmins for Chapleau, Ontario on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight. There, a seriously injured person was to be boarded andflown to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The aircraft proceeded from Timmins en route at 12,000 feet, and, on arrival at Chapleau, theaircraft overflew the airport at low altitude and crashed 1.5 miles southwest of the airport. The four occupants were fatally injured, and the aircraft was destroyed by the impact and post-impact fire."
338,ACC839,"The Twin Otter left the oil fields at Hamada around 07:05 on a regular daily oilfield crew-change flight to Tripoli (TIP). Twelve employees of Arabian Gulf Oil Co/AGOCO and Halliburton Company were on board. Due to military activities in the area of the flight route, the crew were instructed to return to Hamada. In the meantime a thick morning mist had suddenly precipitated at Hamada. The crew circled the area for a while. While attempting to land, the plane contacted an asphalted pipeline bridge which was crossing just west of the main [concrete] runway, hit a wooden electrical pylon, came to rest and burnt.He pilot had probably mistaken the bridge for the runway. Also, a DF beacon was located about half a mile offset westwards from the runway."
339,ACC840,"The Boeing 707 departed Dar Es Salaam (DAR) on a cargo flight to Brussels (BRU), Belgium via Cairo (CAI), Egypt. Weather at Cairo was poor with a visibility of 400 m. After two missed approaches, at 20:53 and 21:07, the crew decided to divert to Luxor. The aircraft did not reach Luxor and crashed into a residential area at Karm `Umran, 45 km North of Luxor. The aircraft presumably ran out of fuel."
340,ACC841,"The aircraft encountered turbulence while approaching the missed approach point of Aspen Airport (ASE) runway 15. A missed approach procedure was executed and a left turn was made at 15 DME. The pilot did not execute a right hand turn as he was supposed to, because he feared that the plane might stall when initiating an immediate right hand turn over higher terrain. The airspeed decayed to 96 knots and the aircraft collided with trees on a mountain."
341,ACC842,"After departing the floatplane base on a company VFR flight plan, the Otter proceeded northwest along a salt water strait at a low altitude above water. Two miles Northwest of the airport the aircraft entered a snow squall and the pilot attempted a steep turn to reverse course. During the turn the aircraft impacted and sank in 167 feet deep water."
342,ACC843,A possible cargo shift caused the aircraft to enter a stall on climbout following a runway 35L takeoff. The aircraft crashed and caught fire.
343,ACC844,Overran icy runway 16 and went down a steep embankment. Braking action was nil and the drag chute failed to open properly.
344,ACC845,"United Airlines Flight 811, a Boeing 747-122, N4713U, took off from Honolulu (HNL), Hawaii at 01:33 local time, bound for Sydney, Australia, with an intermediate stop at Auckland, New Zealand. The initial climb passed through an area of thunderstorms, so the captain elected to keep the seat belt sign on. As the aircraft was climbing, between 22,000 and 23,000 feet, explosive decompression was experienced. An emergency was declared at approximately 02:20 HST. The captain initiated a 180-degree left turn to avoid a thunderstorm and proceeded toward HNL. The forward lower lobe cargo door had opened in flight, taking with it a large portion of the forward right side of the cabin fuselage. The starboard side engines (no.3 and 4) were damaged and had to be shut down. Parts of the leading and trailing edge flaps where also damaged resulting in the crew electing to use only 10-degrees trailing edge flaps for landing (a non-normal configuration). This resulted in the aircraft having to land at a higher speed than it would under normal conditions. The aircraft was cleared to land at HNL runway 8L. At 02:34 HST, Honolulu tower was notified by the flight crew that the airplane was stopped and an emergency evacuation had commenced on the runway. During the decompression, nine passengers had been ejected from the airplane and lost at sea."
345,ACC846,"Air Ontario Flight 1363, a Fokker F-28 jet, crashed during takeoff from Dryden Municipal Airport, Ontario, Canada. Of the 69 persons on board, 24 suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft in question, registration C-FONF, had suffered from a malfunctioning auxiliary power unit (APU) for the five days preceding the accident. Throughout the week preceding March 10, Air Ontario maintenance attempted, with limited success, to cure the APU problems. On March 9 it was decided to defer the repair of the APU until the aircraft returned to Toronto on the night of March 10. This meant that the aircraft was dispatched with the APU inoperable. On the morning of March 10, C-FONF departed Winnipeg on a round trip flight to Dryden, Thunder Bay and back as flight 1362/3. Since no external power unit was available at Dryden, the engines couldn't be restarted in case of engine shutdown on the ground.  The flight to Thunder Bay was unentful apart from a slight delay due to poor weather at Thunder Bay. As the aircraft was prepared for the return flight, it appeared that the aircraft was overweight as a result of ten additional passengers having transferred to the flight due to an earlier cancellation. The Air Ontario duty manager decided to off-load fuel and to arrange refuelling at Dryden. This caused an additional delay of 35 minutes.The Fokker F-28 departed Thunder Bay at 11:55 hours EST, about one hour behind schedule. The aircraft landed at Dryden at 11:39 hours CST. It began to snow lightly when the aircraft landed.Between 11:40 and 12:01, Air Ontario 1363 was refuelled with the right engine operating and with the passengers remaining on board the aircraft. This so called 'hot refuelling' procedure was followed because the APU was unserviceable. Eight passengers deplaned in Dryden and seven passengers boarded the aircraft.Meanwhile, snow was accumulating on the wings, forming a layer of 1/8-1/4 inch. No de-icing was done because de-icing with either engine running was prohibited by both Fokker and Air Ontario. The aircraft then taxied to runway 29 for departure, but was instructed to hold as there was a Cessna 150 on approach. The snow was continuing to fall heavily, becoming increasingly thick on the wings. At 12:09 the aircraft started its takeoff roll on the slush-covered runway 29. There was an accumulation of at least one-half inch of wet, layered snow on the wings of the F-28 as it began its takeoff roll.After a longer than normal takeoff roll, the aircraft was rotated near taxiway Alpha, at approximately the 3500 foot mark. The aircraft lifted off slightly, began to shudder, and then settled back down onto the runway. The takeoff roll then continued and the aircraft was rotated a second time, finally lifting off at approximately the 5700 mark of the 6000 foot runway. It flew over the end of the runway approximately 15 feet above the ground. It thereafter failed to gain altitude and mushed through the air in a nose-high attitude, before commencing to strike trees.The aircraft crashed and came to rest in a wooded area, 3156 feet past the runway end and caught fire."
346,ACC847,"While attempting to land at Tiraora Lodge the pilot was dazzled by low sun and elected to overshoot. The aircraft made a low turn to avoid high ground, struck a telephone wire and descended out of control into the sea."
347,ACC848,Crashed shortly after the pilot radioed that he was attempting an emergency landing in the jungle because of engine problems.
348,ACC849,"Before the flight, the pilots of two Beechcraft 200 aircraft evaluated weather reports at a fixed base operation and made a computer weather inquiry. They departed Santa Monica Airport, CA (SMO), on a positioning flight to Farmington Municipal Airport, NM (FMN), without filing a flight plan. While en route, the lead aircraft was about 1 to 3 minutes ahead of the second aircraft. The second pilot reported they were at about 4500 ft msl as they neared mountains and the clouds were about 1000 ft above. As they continued eastward in a valley, the second pilot heard the lead pilot report he was 'going up.' This was the last known transmission from the lead aircraft. The second pilot continued his flight in VMC. Two days later, the lead aircraft was found, where it had crashed about 100 ft below the top of a 7400 ft mountain ridge. Impact occurred on a heading of about 030 deg. The mountain ridge was oriented on headings of 060 and 240 degrees."
349,ACC850,A forced landing was made following a fire in the no. 2 engine. The fire spread to the fuel tanks following landing.
350,ACC851,"The pilot of a chartered BN-2A-26 Islander had planned the direct track for the flight from Cockatoo Island to Derby, Australia at 5500 feet above sea level.When the pilot gave his departure call he amended his cruising level to below 5000 feet. No further calls were received from the aircraft. The Cockatoo Island work boat was 56 kilometres north-north-west of Derby, and approximately 20 kilometres west of the direct track between Cockatoo Island and Derby. The crew of the boat observed an aircraft approaching at very low level. The aircraft passed over the boat approximately 5-7 metres above the deck, and entered a right hand turn. During the turn the right wing tip struck the water causing the aircraft to cartwheel and crash about 400 metres from the boat. The fuselage broke open on impact and the occupants were subsequently rescued by the crew of the boat. The pilot declined to provide any information which might have clarified the circumstances of the accident, however, available information indicates that he carried out an unauthorized low pass over the boat. During the turn following the low pass, he misjudged the aircraft's height and the right wing tip struck the water."
351,ACC852,The aircraft crashed during a training flight.
352,ACC853,"A Cuban immigrant, who came to the U.S. as part of the Mariel boatlift, hijacked an American Airlines Boeing 727 and demanded to be flown to Cuba. The flight was en route from Dallas to Miamiand was carrying 157 passengers and crew. The hijacker stated he was armed with a pistol and explosives. In actuality he had a starter pistol, two knives and a pair of scissors. After the aircraft landed in Miami to refuel, the hijacker surrendered."
353,ACC854,"The aircraft ran off the strip during takeoff, cart wheeled and struck a building."
354,ACC855,"The no. 1 engine began to vibrate shortly after takeoff. The engine was shut down and the crew wanted to return to Zella, but couldn't maintain height. The aircraft crashed in the desert."

357,ACC858,"Climbing through 200-300 feet after takeoff a portion of the right aileron fabric separated. Then the pilot's control wheel became free. Although the mechanic in the right seat told him that his controls were functioning normally, the pilot disagreed and he ditched the aircraft."
358,ACC859,"A Douglas C-118A (DC-6A) fire fighting plane was destroyed in an accident near Sainte-Anne-des-Monts, QC, Canada. All four crew members were killed.The Conifair plane took off from Bonaventure Airport, QC (YVB) at 19:15 for a spray operation 30 miles southeast of Sainte-Anne-des-Monts. This was to be the last spraying flight of the season out of the Bonaventure base. A crew of four was on board, including two flight engineers who were on a familiarization training flight. The aircraft was carrying 2,952 U.S. gallons of Dipel 132, a non-toxic microbial insecticide.The aircraft arrived over the spray area at 19:35. An inertial navigation system (INS) to follow pre-established spraying tracks. The first track was sprayed uneventfully. At the end of the first track, the aircraft made a 180-degree turn to spray the second track, which was parallel to and about 800 feet northeast of the first track. This meant that the aircraft had to fly from a valley at an elevation of 1,000 feet above sea level (asl) up a mountain consisting of two levels. The first level is about 1,800 feet asl and about 3,280 feet along the flight path. After the first level, the terrain rose within approximately 1,000 feet along the flight path, to the summit of the mountain at an elevation of 2,175 feet asl.The two occupants of a Cessna 310 spotter aircraft observed a decrease of the DC-6A ground speed during the climb over the first level of the mountain. They then noticed that the aircraft yawed and started a steep, left turn. The spotter crew stated that, shortly after the start of the left turn, the DC-6A left wing began to strike trees. The aircraft nosed down, crashed on the side of the mountain, and exploded at an elevation of 2,050 feet asl."
359,ACC860,The aircraft crashed 10 min after takeoff.

Flight PR124 arrived from Zamboanga Airport (ZAM) and was cleared to land on runway 06 in poor visibility and heavy rain. The 1-11 overran the runway and crossed a road, destroying some cars. Eight passengers on board several vehicles were killed."
362,ACC863,"Flight Air Freight 1 was a scheduled night freight flight between Palmerston North, Auckland and Christchurch. The crew consisted of a training captain and two new co-pilots who were to fly alternate legs as co-pilot and observer. The co-pilots ADI of the Convair CV-580 in question had a known intermittent defect, but had been retained in service. The aircrafts MEL however did not permit this flight to be undertaken with an unserviceable ADI. The aircraft nevertheless departed Palmerston North and arrived at Auckland at about 20:30. It was unloaded and reloaded with 11 pallets of cargo. On the next leg, to Christchurch, the handling pilot was to be the other co-pilot. Although she had completed her type rating on the Convair 580 this was her first line flight as a crew member. The flight was cleared to taxi to runway 23 for departure. Takeoff was commenced at 21:59. The aircraft climbed to a height of approx. 400 feet when it pitched down. It entered a gradual descent until it contacted the ground 387 m beyond the end of runway 23 and 91 m left of the extended centreline. The aircraft then crashed and broke up in the tidal waters of Manukau Harbour."

There were 49 passengers and five crew members on board.At 07:40 the crew radioed that they expected over point Bravo at 07:59 and at Islamabad at 08:32. This was the last transmission received from the crew.The flight was declared missing. It is presumed that the aircraft crashed, killing all aboard."
368,ACC869,"After takeoff from Labinsk, at an altitude of 100-120 m, the left engine failed. The crew decided to return to the departure airport. When turning back, a left roll began to develop and the aircraft lost altitude. The pilots made an emergency landing with retracted landing gear on an alfalfa field near the airport. There was no fire. Three passengers received minor injuries."
369,ACC870,"The aircraft suffered a hydraulics failure while en route to Frunze (now Bishkek). The landing gear could not be lowered, forcing the crew to carry out a wheels-up landing on the grass at Frunze. The aircraft suffered substantial damage but all 3 crew and 40 passengers escaped unhurt."
370,ACC871,"During arrival, the flight was issued the current altimeter setting. The pilot requested vectors for an approach to runway 18, but the ARTCC controller could not accommodate the request. The pilot was cleared for a VOR/DME-A approach. MDA for the approach was 1080 feet msl (600 feet agl). FBO personnel observed the aircraft fly over the airport and advised that it was too low. One of the pilots replied that they would be 'staying under the clouds.' The pilots had planned to land on runway 36, but reported they lost sight of the runway and would change to runway 18. Subsequently, the aircraft collided with a tree about 1 mile NNE of the airport, while on a westerly heading (approx position of base leg for a VFR pattern). The aircraft came to rest about 700 feet west of the tree and was destroyed by impact and fire. The weather was in part: scattered clouds at 200 feet, overcast at 900 feet, visibility 3 miles with rain and fog, wind from 360 deg at 7 kts. The airport manager estimated there was a 200 feet ceiling at the airport."
371,ACC872,A Moroccan man hijacked a Royal Air Maroc ATR-42. The aircraft was carrying 8 passengers and crew. The hijacker was armed with a toy pistol and a toy hand grenade. He threatened to blow up the plane if his demands were not met.The hijacker surrendered to authorities after negotiations.
372,ACC873,"A Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III passenger plane, operating as Skylink Flight 070 was destroyed in accident at Terrace Airport, BC (YXT), Canada. All five passengers and two crew members were killed.Flight 070 took off from Vancouver, BC (YVR) at 06:51 on a scheduled domestic flight to Terrace, BC. At 08:20 Flight 070 was cleared for an approach at Terrace. At 08:27, at an altitude of 1,200 feet asl and just prior to reaching the published missed approach point (MAP), the captain stated ""OK, I got the button here."" Fourteen seconds after this, the captain saw the button of runway 27. At approximately this same time, the aircraft was observed on what corresponded to a downwind leg for runway 15 at about 500 feet above ground level (agl), flying straight and level over the threshold of runway 27, with the landing gear down. The aircraft crossed the localizer transmitter at an altitude of 1,100 feet asl and at an airspeed of 140 knots. Approximately 30 seconds after crossing the localizer transmitter, the aircraft commenced a descent out of 1,100 feet, and the flaps were lowered to the full position. The aircraft then levelled at an altitude of approximately 900 feet. At or about this same time, the aircraft was observed on base leg for runway 15 at a low altitude, close to the east/west ridge located about 1.5 miles north of the airport. Twenty-six seconds after full flap was selected, a missed approach was initiated, and the landing gear and flaps were selected up. Within five seconds of the initiation of the missed approach, the aircraft began to accelerate and a rate of climb of approximately 1,200 feet per minute was established. This rate of climb quickly diminished to zero, followed by the start of a descent which quickly increased to 3,000 feet per minute. As the aircraft descended, the co-pilot called ""descending"" twice. A few seconds later, the aircraft struck trees on the west side of runway 15 just inside the airport perimeter. A second and final impact with the ground occurred just outside the airport perimeter approximately 800 feet from the initial tree strike. A fire erupted following the ground impact."
373,ACC874,"Descended below MDA on a nighttime runway 06 NDB approach. The Citation hit trees and crashed 2,5 miles SW of the runway threshold. The elevation of the crash site was 600 feet msl, at a point where the MDA was 1160 feet msl."
374,ACC875,"The airplane came in too high and too fast. It landed at 893 from the end of the grass runway (length: 1305 m). The Antonov skidded off the runway and collided with an 1,20 m high concrete pillar, which was part of the airport perimeter fence. The airplane was severely damaged because it had also ran across some holes in the ground. A fuel tank was compromised and the fuselage was damaged.Nevertheless, the captain decided to taxy back to the apron. While taxiing back, further damage occurred and propeller blades broke away."
375,ACC876,"The Caravan I took off at night from a private/unlighted strip with a professional (ATP) pilot and the non-instrument rated owner/pilot at the controls. After takeoff, the aircraft entered a slight left turn. Subsequently, it hit the top of a tall pine tree, about 80 feet (25 m) above ground level and 202 feet (62 m) left of the runway centreline. The aircraft then crashed into other trees after travelling about an additional 450 feet (138 m). It was not determined which pilot was actually flying the plane. Toxicology checks showed the owner had a blood/alcohol level of 0.041% (41 mg/dl) and a urine/alcohol level of 0.012% (12 mg/dl). Toxicology checks of the professional pilot's blood and urine were negative for alcohol."
376,ACC877,"A muffled explosion was heard and flames were seen coming from the vent near seat 3D. The aircraft, being prepared for a flight to Edmonton, was evacuated as smoke filled the cabin. A mechanic had noted a low passenger oxygen generator control unit and replaced the oxygen generator cylinders. He then saw a white flash engulf the unit. Another 35 oxygen generator system leaks were found in Delta's fleet."
377,ACC878,The Islander had departed Adana (ADA) for a photo mapping flight of a forested area near the border with Syria. Some 20 km from the Syrian border the airplane was shot down by two Syrian Air Force MiG-21bis fighter jets.
378,ACC879,"The Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane departed Ulyanovsk on a training/cargo flight to Leninakan. The aircraft carried a cargo of 37200 kg. Approaching Leninakan the flight was cleared to descend to 3300 metres. During the descent the approach controller reported the airport pressure being 637 mm Hg. After issuing a further clearance down to 1100 metres, the controller corrected the airport pressure to 637 mm Hg. Erroneously the crew programmed their barometric altimeters using 736 instead of 636 mm Hg, causing a difference in altitude indication of about 1100 metres. Descent was continued at a vertical speed of 10 m/sec. At a height of 270 metres the GPWS alarm began to sound and continued to 19 seconds. Then the flight engineer suddenly informed the captain of the mistake, but no corrective action was taken. Ten seconds later the aircraft struck terrain and crashed."
379,ACC880,A gust of wind on touchdown caused the pilot to lose control. The Twin Otter struck a ditch and sustained irreparable damage.
380,ACC881,Aloha IslandAir Flight 1712 departed Kahului at 18:25 for a 25-minute VFR flight to Kaunakakai. The aircraft climbed to 1000 feet and descended to 500 feet at 18:30.

382,ACC883,"A Cessna 551 Citation II/SP corporate jet, registered LN-AAE, was destroyed in a CFIT accident near Bardufoss Airport (BDU), Norway. The passenger and three crew members were killed. The airplane took off from Tromsø/Langnes Airport (TOS) at 22:48 with call sign Scanvip (AXP) 05 for an air ambulance service to Bardufoss Airport (BDU). At 22:52 the crew established radio contact with the Bardufoss control tower, reporting at FL80. The controller reported that they could expect a runway 29 ILS clearance.Two minutes later the crew asked for clearance to go down to 6000 feet. The controller approved the descent and cleared the flight for the approach, instructing the crew to report when established on the ILS.At about 22:57:50 at a position about 8 NM North of the Målselv (MLV) NDB, the airspeed increased from 265 kts to 285 kts over a distance of about 5 NM. This speed was maintained up to the NDB. At 22:59:30 LN-AAE passed the MLV NDB. Instead of performing the left hand procedure turn from 174 degrees to 122 degrees, the crew continued on the present heading for about 30 seconds at an airspeed about 100 knots above the recommended approach speed. The aircraft was about 2 NM (4 km) south in relation to the established procedure pattern. The airplane should still have been at 6000 feet until established on the ILS but it had descended 1250 feet below the minimum altitude until it collided with a relatively flat mountain ridge just south of the summit of Langfjelltind (4935 FT)."
383,ACC884,"The Antonov An-24B of Aeroflot's Uralsk division was operating a charter service to fly oil workers from Perm to Sovetsky. The departure was delayed because of poor weather at Sovetsky.The weather gradually improved and the aircraft then departed Perm at 13:55 Moscow time. After an uneventful flight, the aircraft positioned for an approach to runway 30. The approach was conducted in darkness and poor visibility conditions. The weather reported to the crew on final approach (80 m overcast, 2000 m visibility) was below minima for the An-24.Nevertheless, the flight crew continued the approach. By then the aircraft had already descended below the glideslope.The radio altimeter warned the crew when the descent was continued below a height of 62 m, but the aircraft kept descending.At a height of 35 meters the flight crew attempted to pull up, but the aircraft collided with trees at a distance of 180 m to the right of the extended runway centreline. The no.2 engine autofeathered as a result, but the no.1 engine was delivering go around power. This caused the aircraft to enter a 27° right hand bank. This was briefly countered by the crew before the aircraft again rolled hard right and subsequently impacted terrain 700 m from the threshold, 250 m right of the extended centreline."
384,ACC885,"The flight from Mount Isa, Australia, had been conducted in rain and cloud. At 5000 feet during the descent, the pilot became visual with the runway lights of Kidston Airport and the nearby goldmine. The runway was overflown, and it was noted that the windsock was showing no significant wind. During the circuit for landing on runway 21, increasing rain and cloud was noticed on downwind, and on left base the pilot experienced heavy rain and strong wind gusts. The pilot had turned the windscreen wipers on but they were not clearing the windscreen effectively. Forward visibility was significantly reduced, and on final approach the pilot was having difficulty keeping the aircraft aligned with the runway due to the turbulence and wind gusts. He elected to go around and carry out another circuit. During the next circuit the conditions had not improved, and the pilot again decided to go around, as it had become increasingly difficult to maintain runway alignment. As the go-around was commenced the pilot heard a loud bang and realised the aircraft had struck trees. The aircraft was climbed and the Kidston NDB approach procedure was carried out. The pilot became visual at 2900 feet and carried a circuit and landing on runway 03. (Kidston is 1620 feet above sea level). After shutdown the aircraft was inspected and was found to have sustained tree impact damage to the left inboard leading edge, the left propeller, and the left horizontal stabiliser. The pilot believes the tree strike occurred as a result of downdraft associated with the storms in the immediate area. The Kidston aerodrome is established according to the provisions of AIP AGA-6 and although approved for the night operation being conducted, it does not have an approach guidance lighting system. The aerodrome does not have any other ground lighting in the immediate vicinity other than the runway lights, and this may lead to the pilot having a false perception of height and runway perspective. It is considered that the lack of approach guidance, combined with the prevailing weather conditions, contributed significantly to the cause of this accident. There is rising terrain on the approaches to runway 21. The pilot reported that he was having difficulty with forward visibility due to the ineffectiveness of the windscreen wipers. The effect of heavy rain on aircraft windshields may lead to a number of visual errors. One effect is to make objects appear to be lower in relation to the aircraft than they actually are. Whilst it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of the error, the elements were present in this accident, and may have given the pilot a false impression of his height in relation to the runway lights."
385,ACC886,"After takeoff from Dzhambul Airport (DMB), the aircraft entered an area of with icing conditions and fog. These conditions were not forecast.As a result of icing, engine power decreased. The crew decided to return to the departure airport but the airspeed decreased until the airplane stalled and crashed."
386,ACC887,"The aircraft, flown by Tepper Aviations chief, reportedly was carrying out a flight on behalf of the CIA to provide the Angolan UNITA guerrilla forces with weapons. It crashed while coming in to land at Jamba. These flights were flown at night at a very low altitude to avoid MPLA radar detection. The runway at Jamba was dirt, the approach was over trees, and the portable runway lighting was probably marginally adequate."
387,ACC888,Crashed at sea.
388,ACC889,"During a practice instrument approach, the left gear would not lower. An emergency gear-up landing was successfully carried out."
0,ACC890,"The aircraft was taking off from a 920 metre grass strip in moderate to heavy rain. Takeoff weight was about 60 kilograms below maximum authorised. Witnesses reported that the aircraft became airborne well beyond the normal position, and then only momentarily, before the pilot abandoned the takeoff. The aircraft crossed the end of the strip and ran across a beach before coming to rest in chest deep water. The pilot of a following aircraft later indicated that there was a significant down wind component during the first aircraft's takeoff attempt."
1,ACC891,"The ""smoke in the rear cargo hold"" warning activated during cruise at 10,600 m. The presence of smoke was confirmed but the source of fire could not be identified. Then the APU fire warning activated. The crew initiated an emergency descent to land at an intermediate airport. During descent the fire warning in both powerplants activated, the DC electrical system went dead, the attitude indicators, the compass system and the flap extension system shut off and the electromechanical altimeters stopped working. The crew force landed in a snow-covered field 3 km from Pervouralsk. The aircraft collided with irrigation equipment and broke up."
2,ACC892,"The Metro III passenger plane operated on a scheduled flight from Salt Lake City International Airport, UT (SLC) to Elko Airport, NV (EKO).During arrival, the flight crew of SkyWest Airlines flight 5855 requested a VOR/DME-B approach to runway 23 at the Elko Airport, which was approved. As the approach continued, the flight crew reported over the Bullion VOR. Approximately 30 seconds later, the aircraft impacted the top of a mountain, about 100 feet before reaching the VOR station. The airplane sustained substantial damage and four occupants sustained serious injuries.Elevation of the crash site was about 6460 ft. The minimum published crossing altitude at the VOR was 7000 ft. The airport was 4.1 miles from the VOR at an elevation of 5135 feet.Weather at the time of the approach was poor with low clouds."
3,ACC893,"Flight 824 departed Denver at 06:42 for an IFR flight at FL180 to Montrose. The aircraft climbed to FL145 and maintained that altitude until crashing 50 feet (15 m) below the summit of the 14,221-ft (4350 m) Mount Massive. Toxicological tests revealed marijuana metabolite level of 37 ng/ml in urine and 1 ng/ml in blood. The pilot was once convicted in 1974 for possession of controlled substance, but had no other alcohol/drug convictions."
4,ACC894,"The Caravan was overloaded by 360 lb (163 kg) structurally and 1100 lb (500 kg) for flight in icing conditions. With moderate snow falling, the takeoff run on runway 15 was described as long. The wings were rocking and the plane struck trees and crashed. A FedEx Caravan crashed under the same circumstances just about 40 km (25 miles) away at 20:33."
5,ACC895,"The Sabreliner 40 sustained damage in a runway excursion accident at Detroit City Airport, MI (DET). The accident happened after landing on runway 15."
6,ACC896,"A Metro II operated by Perimeter Airlines returned to land at Winnipeg International Airport, Canada when the crew received various warnings. As the aircraft climbed through 13,000ft., the crew reportedly received indications of a possible loss of hydraulics followed by an undercarriage-unsafe warning. Shortly after this the wing area overheat light came on. Upon returning the crew heard two explosions, later determined to have been the tyres on the left undercarriage exploding. The crew decided to shut down and feather the no. 1 propeller and extended the undercarriage. A major portion of the left undercarriage fell away. The aircraft landed on runway 12 at and veered off during the roll out. A fuel system pressurisation line towards the rear of the no. 1 engine had apparently developed a crack and allowed a fine mist of fuel to be sprayed into the wheel well where it was ignited by an unknown heat source."
7,ACC897,Suddenly dove into a field as it prepared to land.
8,ACC898,"The aircraft was used to practice stalls in landing configuration when both engines quit. Both engines had overheated and due to the vibration, the no. 2 engine separated.A forced landing was carried out and the aircraft caught fire."
9,ACC899,"The pilot reported that shortly after take-off on the seventh parachuting flight for the day the left engine fuel low pressure warning light illuminated. Activation of the auxiliary pump did not rectify the problem and the engine stopped. Following completion of the left engine shutdown drills and an apparent inability to outclimb the rising terrain, the pilot elected to shut down the right engine and land in a paddock. Landing gear extension had just commenced when the aircraft impacted the ground. The aircraft groundlooped to the left in the landing slide. As the parachuting operation involved climbing to 12000 feet, to enhance climb performance and minimise sortie time, minimum fuel was carried. The pilot and the operator considered that the regulations relating to fuel reserve requirements did not apply to parachuting operations. The planned fuel for the flight was therefore substantially less than statutory requirements. A complete fuel drain and quantity check revealed only 19.5 lbs (11 litres) of fuel remained in the left tank and 231 lbs (130 litres) in the right. The amount of fuel burned since the last refuel was 24 lbs (13.5 litres). The inspection of the aircraft fuel system revealed that the fuel quantity indication system was defective. The left outer fuel quantity sender unit was unserviceable and showed a reading on the left outer fuel gauge of 100 lbs and empty on the left inboard gauge when both the inboard and outboard fuel tanks were completely empty. The pilot was unaware of the significance of this fuel gauge indication anomaly. All fuel pumps were serviceable and both engines were found to be capable of operating throughout the design power range. The wind at the time was south-easterly at 10 knots gusting to 15 knots. The into-wind takeoff was over rising terrain with a 5-7 knot crosswind from the left. It is considered that during the initial climb phase of the flight insufficient fuel remained to cover the left fuel pumps and outlet ports, effectively starving the left engine of fuel. No reason could be found for the inability of the aircraft to outclimb the terrain on the remaining engine. Performance tests revealed that, at worst, the aircraft would have been capable of maintaining level flight following the failure of the left engine. It is probable that the visual illusion caused by the rising ground on the initial climb track induced the pilot to assume that the aircraft was descending."
10,ACC900,"The GAF Nomad N.24A transport plane was destroyed in an accident near Mallala, SA, Australia. The pilot was killed.The tail plane broke off in flight and the aircraft crashed. The aircraft was allocated by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU).After being manufactured in 1982, the airplane was used by GAF (renamed Aerospace Technologies of Australia - ASTA in 1987) for testing. Amongst others, service records indicated 177 hours of single engine ground running. This meant that the airplane was subjected to many high frequency asymmetric cycles.Cracks initiated and grew predominately due to torsional loading. Upon delivery to the RAAF, the airplane was inspected but this failed to detect significant cracking.The tailplane centre section failed in flight, 19 hours after the inspection."
11,ACC901,The aircraft overran the runway and ended up in the sea.
12,ACC902,The crew of the Argosy cargo plane aborted the approach to their destination of Wellington Airport because the left hand undercarriage failed to lock down.It was decided to divert to Blenheim-Woodbourne Airport (BHE) where the SAFE Air engineering base was located.During landing rollout the left main undercarriage collapsed and the airplane veered off the side of runway 25.
13,ACC903,"A Martin 4-0-4 suffered a runway excursion accident at Camiare Airstrip in Bolivia, causing the starboard undercarriage to fail.The airplane hade departed Camiare Airstrip on a cargo flight to La Paz when, about seven minutes after takeoff, the no. 2 engine reportedly began to 'backfire' and developed a 'strong vibration'. Returning to Camiare, the pilot carried out a down-wind landing as he was not able to fly a circuit due to problems maintaining altitude."
14,ACC904,"Force landed following an engine failure, narrowly missing a row of houses. The DC-3 struck an electricity post and crashed in a rice field. It is reported that the crew tried to takeoff for the second time; the first attempt ended with a forced landing on a taxiway. MATS was not authorized to carry passengers. About one year previous (May 6, 1989) another MATS DC-3 (RP-C82) crashed near Manila, also carrying passengers without being authorized to do so. There were no fatal injuries in that accident though."
15,ACC905,"On the morning of 30 April 1990, the crew of Shackleton AEW2 WR965 took off from RAF Lossiemouth to participate in a maritime exercise in the Benbecula area to the west of mainland Scotland. The exercise was to be in two parts with a time interval between. To make most economical use of the Shackleton's flying time it was intended to utilise the time interval to undertake some continuation training for which the crew had appropriate authorisation. Although the weather was forecast to be generally clear in the aircraft's operating area there were areas of low cloud and poor visibility over Scottish coastal areas.The first part of the sortie was completed without incident and at 09:45 UTC the crew took the opportunity to participate with a Tornado F3 in mutual training which required the Shackleton's radar to be set to standby/off. After completing this training, the crew commenced their own continuation training which was to include a visual approach to Benbecula airfield.The crew contacted Benbecula Air Traffic Control (ATC) at 10:25 UTC requesting permission for an approach, stating that they were about 20 miles west of the airfield; permission was given and Benbecula ATC passed their actual weather to the crew. Subsequent investigation determined, however, that the aircraft was actually 15 miles north of the position which it had reported at this time. At 10:30 two RAF personnel saw the Shackleton orbiting an island some 12 miles to the north of Benbecula airfield, and at 10:34 the Shackleton crew called Benbecula ATC stating that the weather was not sufficiently good for an approach and that they were turning right and climbing. At around 10:37 it struck the ground about 30 ft below the summit of an 823 ft hill on the Isle of Harris.Reliable evidence indicates that at that time and in that vicinity the cloudbase was 200 ft above mean sea level, with cloud tops at 3000 ft. At impact, the aircraft was in controlled flight with all four engines developing cruise power."
16,ACC906,"Nosegear collapse on landing. A fire erupted and the aircraft, a C-54 firefighting conversion, was damaged beyond repair."
17,ACC907,"Frontier Air Flight 1602 took off from Timmins at 20:43 on a scheduled domestic flight to Moosonee. The flight proceeded to Moosonee at 7,000 feet and was cleared for an approach at 21:21. The crew elected to fly the VOR runway 24 approach. At 21:29, the crew reported on the 061-degree radial of the VOR at five nm outbound. Shortly after intercepting the 061-degree radial inbound, the crew initiated a descent to the 440-foot MDA. While in the descent, the aircraft broke through the lowest cloud layer at 900 feet asl, approximately 9.2 nm from the VOR At this point, both pilots had the runway lights in sight, and the captain decided to change to a visual approach and proceed inbound at 700 feet asl. Shortly after advising the co-pilot of his intentions, the captain initiated the before-landing cockpit check and lowered the landing gear. Immediately thereafter, the aircraft struck trees and crashed."
18,ACC908,"Cessna 500 VH-ANQ was operating the Proserpine to Mareeba leg of a charter flight The aircraft departed Proserpine at 16:35 hours. The charter flight had been organised to transport members of five local government authorities from the Cairns/Atherton Tablelands area to a Local Government Association Conference at Airlie Beach, Queensland.The flight plan indicated that the flight would follow Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) with a planned cruising altitude of FL330. The aircraft was planned to track via overhead Townsville then direct to Mareeba with a flight time interval of 68 minutes. The flight apparently continued normally and at 17:26 the aircraft was cleared to descend to FL170 and instructed to call Cairns Approach.On first contact with Cairns Approach, the pilot advised that the aircraft was tracking for Mareeba via the 163 radial at 41 miles (76 kilometres) DME from Biboohra. (There are no radio navigational aids at Mareeba, the nearest aids for tracking and instrument approach purposes are at Biboohra, about 16 kilometres north of Mareeba). The aircraft was advised to maintain FL170 but a short time later was cleared to descend to FL120. The pilot stated that he would not be closing down the engines at Mareeba and that his estimated departure time was 17:50.At 17:35 hours VH-ANQ was cleared to descend to 10,000 feet and one minute later the pilot advised that the aircraft was ""approaching over Mareeba and visual"". Cairns Approach advised VH-ANQ that there would be a short delay at 10,000 feet and following a request from the pilot gave approval for the aircraft to circle over Mareeba.At 17:40 hours, Cairns Approach instructed the aircraft to descend to 7,000 feet. This transmission, and other subsequent transmissions to the aircraft, went unanswered.The wreckage of VH-ANQ was ultimately located on the eastern slopes of Mt Emerald, 15 kilometres south of Mareeba Airport, by searching helicopters at 0240 hours on 12 May 1990. The aircraft initially impacted the mountainside with the left wingtip, while travelling on a track of about 340 degrees Magnetic. At the time it was in a wings level attitude at an angle of descent of eight degrees. It then struck the ground just below the apex of a ridge and the wreckage spread in a fan shape, at an angle of 30 degrees, along a centreline track of 350 degrees Magnetic."
19,ACC909,"A Beechcraft 1900C, operating for Aerolift Philippines as flight 75 to Surigao, took off from runway 13 at Manila's international airport. During takeoff the no. 2 engine failed. The airplane began turning to the right as the crew radioed that they were returning to the airport. With the undercarriage down and the flaps still in takeoff position the airplane impacted a house in the suburban Paranaque neighbourhood. All 21 aboard the plane and a family of four inside the house were killed."
20,ACC910,"The pilot reported that he planned to do a short-field landing to ensure that minimum braking action would be necessary on the wet grass surface. On late final approach, the aircraft encountered a down draft from which the pilot was unable to recover in time to avoid striking the lip of the strip. The left main gear was bent back as a result."
21,ACC911,The Antonov touched down hard and bounced three times on the nose wheel which broke up. The aircraft overran by 83 m and was destroyed by fire.
22,ACC912,"The Boeing struck the ground during a runway 14 DME approach, 12 km short of the runway. The aircraft skidded a few hundred feet, coming to rest with an engine and the tail section separated."
23,ACC913,"Well before the flight was due to depart, the company agent at Mabuiag Island endeavoured to warn the operator that the strip was wet and unsuitable for operations. This attempt to communicate failed due to a local fault in the Telecom system. The pilot was aware of a previous recent accident where a pilot landed short of the runway lip.When he arrived, he assessed the strip as suitable and landed well into the strip. By the time that he discovered that the strip was slippery, it was too late to go around. When it became obvious that he could not stop within the confines of the strip by using normal braking, he attempted a ground loop. The aircraft slid sideways off the end of the strip onto a beach."
24,ACC914,"British Airways flight 5390 to Malaga, Spain, took off from Birmingham International Airport at 07:20 hrs. The co-pilot had been the handling pilot during the take-off and, once established in the climb, the captain was handling the aircraft in accordance with the operator's normal operating procedures. At this stage both pilots had released their shoulder harness, using the release bar on the buckle, and the captain had loosened his lap-strap. At 07:33 hrs as the cabin staff prepared to serve a meal and drinks, and, as the aircraft was climbing through about 17,300 feet pressure altitude, there was a loud bang and the fuselage filled with condensation mist. It was at once apparent to the cabin crew that an explosive decompression had occurred. The captain had been partially sucked out of his windscreen aperture and the flight deck door had been blown onto the flight deck where it lay across the radio and navigation console. The No 3 steward, who had been working on the cabin side of the door, rushed onto the flight deck and grasped the captain round his waist to hold onto him. The purser meanwhile removed the debris of the door and stowed it in the forward toilet. The other two cabin staff instructed the passengers to fasten their seat belts, reassured them and took up their emergency positions. The co-pilot immediately attempted to control the aircraft and, once he had regained control, initiated a rapid descent to FL110. He re-engaged the autopilot which had become disconnected by displacement of the control column during the captain's partial egress and made a distress call on the frequency in use but he was unable to hear its acknowledgment due to the noise of rushing air on the flight deck. There was some delay in establishing two-way communications and consequently the Bristol Sector Controller was not immediately aware of the nature of the emergency. Meanwhile the purser re-entered the flight deck and, having hooked his arm through the seat belts of the fourth crew member jump seat which was located behind the left-hand pilot's seat, was able to assist the No 3 steward in the restraint of the captain. The two men tied to pull the captain back within the aircraft and, although they could see his head and torso through the left Direct Vision window, the effect of the slipstream frustrated their efforts. The No 2 steward entered the flight deck and he was able to relieve the No 3 steward whose arms were losing their strength as they suffered from frostbite and bruising from the windscreen frame. The No 2 steward grasped the captain's right leg, which was stuck between the cockpit coaming and the control column whilst his left leg was wedged against his seat cushion. The steward then strapped himself into the left jump seat and was able to grasp both of the captain's legs but not before he had moved a further 6 to 8 inches out of the window frame. He held him by the ankles until after the aircraft had landed. Meanwhile, the aircraft had descended to FL100 and slowed to about 150 knots(kt). The co-pilot had requested radar vectors to the nearest airport and had been turned towards Southampton Airport and eventually transferred to their approach frequency. Having verified that there was sufficient runway length available for a landing, the co-pilot manoeuvred the aircraft onto a visual final approach to runway 02 and completed a successful landing and stop on the runway at 07:55 hrs. The engines were shut down but the Auxiliary Power Unit, which the co-pilot had started up during the descent, was left running to provide electrical power to certain aircraft systems. As soon as the aircraft came to a halt, passengers were disembarked from the front and rear airstairs while the airport and local fire services recovered the captain back into the aircraft from his position half out of the windscreen frame, where he had remained throughout the descent and landing. He was taken to Southampton General Hospital suffering from bone fractures in his right arm and wrist, a broken left thumb, bruising, frostbite and shock. The other crew members and passengers were medically examined but apart from one steward who had cuts and bruising to his arm there were no other injuries.An investigation showed that the left windscreen, which had been replaced prior to the flight, was blown out under effects of the cabin pressure when it overcame the retention of the securing bolts, 84 of which, out of a total of 90, were of smaller than specified diameter."
25,ACC915,The Ilyushin was struck by a Stinger missile at FL255. Two engines were shut down and a forced landing was made on an unpaved runway with gear and flaps retracted.
26,ACC916,"An Aeroflot Tupolev 134 passenger aircraft on a domestic flight from Riga to Murmansk was hijacked to Helsinki, Finland. The 54 passengers and five crew members were unharmed during the incident. The hijacker, a 20-year old passenger, surrendered peacefully to Finnish authorities and requested political asylum.Although he threatened to detonate an explosive device if his demands were not met, he was found to possess neither weapons nor explosives. In July 1990, the hijacker's request for asylum was denied, and he was extradited to the Soviet Union."
27,ACC917,"The Twin Otter took off from a temporary airstrip in fine weather. The aircraft failed to gain height, banked right and struck a parked Bell 206 helicopter. Part of the wing broke off and the Twin Otter crashed beside the airstrip."
28,ACC918,"An attempt to hijack an Aeroflot Tupolev 154 passenger jet to Turkey was thwarted when the pilot landed the aircraft at Orenburg Airport (REN). The aircraft was on a domestic flight from Krasnodar to Krasnoyarsk with 165 passengers. The hijacker had threatened to poison all on board with chemicals he claimed to possess unless his demand to fly to Turkey was met. Upon landing, he was arrested by Soviet authorities. No chemical or biological agents were found by the authorities."
29,ACC919,The An-32 transport plane crashed in the Ponmudi Mountain range while en route from Tambaram Air Force Station to Thiruvananthapuram in India.
30,ACC920,An attempt to hijack a Tu-134 to Sweden failed when the crew did not accede to the two hijackers' demands. The domestic flight was en route from Riga to Murmansk with 74 passengers when the hijackers threatened to detonate an explosive device unless the aircraft was diverted to Stockholm. The crew landed instead at Petrozavodsk.
31,ACC921,"The aircraft crashed during a forced landing near Bielsko Biala Airport, Poland, following a failure of the engine. The aircraft overturned."
32,ACC922,"The aircraft undershot runway 29 at Cozumel Airport, Mexico, during a visual approach. It operated on a flight from Kingston, Jamaica, to Houston, Texas, USA with an en route stop at Cozumel.The flight contacted Cozumel Tower at 18:33 hours, reporting at 14 DME. The controller then cleared the flight for a VOR/DME approach to runway 29 and to report passing the VOR or field at sight. One minute later, the crew reported having the field in sight and so requested to make a visual approach, directly to runway 29. The controller authorized this and instructed to report at 5 DME.The aircraft was subsequently cleared to land, with wind reported to be calm.The final approach was low and the aircraft hit the ground 500 m short of the threshold."
33,ACC923,"An Aeroflot Tu-154 on a domestic flight from Neryungri to Yakutsk was hijacked over Siberia. The hijackers were a group of 15 prisoners aboard the flight.They overpowered their three guards and confiscated their weapons. The plane returned to Neryungri where six of the prisoners surrendered to authorities. The remaining hijackers were joined by two other prisoners: women and children aboard the flight were exchanged for additional weapons and bullet-proof vests. The plane was refueled at Krasnoyarsk and landed at Tashkent, where negotiations were carried on. The plane again took off and landed at Karachi, where the hijackers surrendered to Pakistani authorities and requested political asylum."
34,ACC924,The Twin Otter and a Bell 206B helicopter (N250CA) were involved in a movie operation. The Bell carried a cameraman. The DHC-6 carried parachutists. The purpose of the operation was to photograph the parachutists exiting the jump aircraft. The pilot of N250CA said he was in formation with the Twin Otter and was maneuvering into camera position when the rotor blades contacted the vertical stabilizer and rudder of N203E. The pilot of N203E was not in a position to have visual contact with the helicopter.
35,ACC925,The Royal Malaysian Air Force C-130 Hercules transport plane skidded off the runway Sibu Airport (SBW) on landing and came to rest in the jungle. Unsecured baggage fell on a passenger resulting in fatal head injuries. The captain reported that engines 3 and 4 were shut down on finals. Upon landing the C-130 veered left and ran into shrubs.The airplane was port of a Royal entourage visiting Sibu.
36,ACC926,"The pilot, a heart transplant surgeon, planned a return flight to Las Cruces to retrieve a donor heart. After takeoff into a dark, clear, moonless night towards open, flat terrain with few ground lights, the aircraft impacted the ground in a left wing/nose slightly low attitude at high speed. The pilot had been awake for 22 hours with little or no rest."
37,ACC927,"The Boeing 727 was ferried back from Malta to Peru after having been leased to Air Malta. The aircraft had left Keflavik for Gander, when at 15:20 a distress message was received by the crew of TWA flight 851 and American 35. The Faucett crew were descending through FL100 with the low fuel light on. They were preparing to ditch. Nothing more was heard from the flight."
38,ACC928,"An Aeroflot YAK-40 aircraft was hijacked to Helsinki, Finland. The aircraft was on a domestic flight from Novgorod to Petrozavodsk and landed at Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport. The hijacker was identified as 41-year old male, who threatened to detonate an improvised explosive device if his demands were not met. Upon landing, he surrendered to authorities and requested political asylum.His request was refused and on December 5 he was extradited to the USSR."
39,ACC929,"The pilot, a company check airman, and an FAA inspector were on board the Metro III aircraft for a checkride which was intended to reassess the pilot's competency. A maintenance test (aileron rigging) was to be performed in conjunction with the check ride. The airplane departed Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport, KY (CVG) at 22:18.The first maneuver to be performed was a no-flap landing. All three pilots stated that the pilot had difficulty managing the aircraft while in the traffic pattern; airspeeds were too slow, and the pilot was constantly manipulating power. The pilot never called for the before landing checklist, and the aircraft touched down on runway 09R with the landing gear up. The check pilot stated that the landing gear warning horn came on briefly, but the pilot added power and silenced the horn. The FAA inspector was seated in a passenger seat for takeoff and landing, and was not aware that the landing gear was not extended."
40,ACC930,"The Yak-40 came in too high on final approach in difficult weather conditions at night. The airplane touched down with a tailwind at excessive speed, overran the runway and collided with an embankment at a speed of 115 km/h. It ended up in a 6 metres deep gully."
41,ACC931,"The aircraft departed for a local parachute dropping sortie. Thunderstorms had been forming to the south-west and north-west, the nearest being about 12 miles from the aerodrome. The surface wind for takeoff was 340 degrees at 10 knots. During climb, the pilot was advised to abort the sortie due to increasing wind. On his return to the field, the windsock was indicating a consistent wind from 230 degrees at 20 knots. No turbulence or rain had been encountered during the descent to runway 23, until final approach, when increasingly severe turbulence was experienced together with light rain. At a height of about 100 feet, the pilot initiated a baulked approach using maximum cruise power with landing gear and flap retracted. The aircraft began to climb away normally, but then experienced zero climb followed by heavy sink. The pilot increased power to maximum and adopted best angle of climb speed, but was unable to prevent the aircraft from settling onto the ground. The pilot subsequently learnt that the aerodrome had been affected by sudden winds gusts estimated to be in the vicinity of 50 knots, resulting in substantial damage to parked aircraft and other objects."
42,ACC932,En route the aircraft contacted ground obstacles causing damage to the left wing and shearing off the left undercarriage. The aircraft continued to Red Lake and landed.
43,ACC933,"USAir Flight 1493 left Columbus at 13:17 for a flight to Los Angeles. The Boeing 737-300, N388US, aircraft entered LAX airspace around 17:57 and was cleared for a CIVET Two Profile Descent and ILS runway 24R approach. At 17:59 this was changed to a runway 24L approach clearance.At about the same time a SkyWest Metro III aircraft (Flight 5569 to Palmdale) taxied out from Terminal 6, Gate 32 to runway 24L. At 18:03 the crew were advised to ""taxi up to and hold short of 24L"" because of other traffic. At 18:04:49 the flight was cleared to taxi into position and hold. Immediately thereafter the controller became preoccupied with instructing WingsWest Flight 5006 who had unintentionally departed the tower frequency. The WingsWest 5072 reporting ready for takeoff caused some confusion because the controller didn't have a flight progress strip in front of her. The strip appeared to have been misfiled at the clearance delivery position. Meanwhile, Flight 5569 was still on the runway at the intersection with taxiway 45, awaiting takeoff clearance.At 18:07 Flight 1493 touched down. Simultaneous to the nosegear touchdown, the Boeing 737 collided with the SkyWest Metro. Both aircraft caught fire and slid to the left into an unoccupied fire station."
44,ACC934,"The BAe-748 transport plane returned to land at Dar Es Salaam International Airport (DAR), Tanzania because the undercarriage reportedly would not retract. After repairs a test flight was then performed. This time the undercarriage would not extend while the aircraft was on approach. Eventually a gear-up landing was made. It was subsequently found that the main undercarriage doors had become stuck partially open."
45,ACC935,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan cargo plane was damaged beyond repair in an accident. The pilot was killed. The VFR flight departed Nain (YDP) and was bound for Goose Bay (YYR), also in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The pilot had descended from the planned en route altitude of 7500 feet to 3500 feet for unknown reasons. The airplane impacted terrain in an open bog in a 55 degree nose and right wing low attitude 85 miles(*137 km) north of Goose Bay. The pilot had radioed an emergency prior to the accident."

51,ACC941,"A Dornier 228-212, registration F-OHAN, crashed in the waters off Nuku Hiva Airport, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia. Ten of the 22 occupants sustained fatal injuries.Air Tahiti flight 805 had taken off from Hiva Ou at 11:10 for a flight to Nuku Hiva. The crew were approaching runway 06 when the no. 1 engine suffered an uncontained failure. Both crewmembers didn't recognize the failure but concentrated on the low oil pressure warning for the engine in question. The approach was abandoned and the aircraft flew parallel to the runway in order to land on runway 24. The Dornier lost altitude and at the very last moment it was decided to carry out an unprepared ditching."
52,ACC942,"The aircraft experienced complete hydraulic failure. The pilot lost steering and brake control and the aircraft drifted off the runway, down an inclined portion of the ramp, and struck the terminal building. The aircraft suffered damage to the left propeller, wind screen, nose cone and radar antenna."

54,ACC944,"Gear-up landing. The crew failed to read out the landing procedure checklist, didn't select the gear down. The circuit breaker was pulled when the warning system horn sounded."
55,ACC945,"During cruise flight the accident flying boat lost oil pressure in the number 2 engine. Flight could not be sustained using the remaining engine. According to the pilot, the remaining engine would overheat when power was applied. The crew descended to just above the water and tried to fly the aircraft in ground effect, but to no avail. They elected to ditch the aircraft. During the landing, the aircraft received substantial damage and was almost immediately flooded, causing the aircraft to sink. The crew escaped, but did not have time to retrieve emergency gear. They were rescued after about 20 hours in the water. Evidence revealed that the pilot did not have a pilot's certificate. No evidence could be found to indicate that the pilot had any experience in the accident aircraft or with any sea plane. Since the aircraft sank, a cause for the engine problems could not be determined."
56,ACC946,"The CL-215 fire fighting aircraft struck tree tops and crashed in a steep right bank, with the aircraft rolling in a near inverted attitude. The trees the aircraft struck were taller than the surrounding timber and blended into the background."
57,ACC947,"During take-off, the pilot felt and heard a thump during rotation. The aircraft would not pressurize, and lost the utility hydraulic fluid. An aircraft on a subsequent take-off reported what appeared to be landing gear debris on the runway. After circling for one hour to burn off fuel, and conducting a tower fly by, the aircraft landed without the nosewheel gear on a foamed runway.During rotation the nose gear separated. As the aircraft passed over it the belly of the aircraft was damaged. Take-off was completed and an emergency landing was conducted with the main gear and the stub of the nose gear shock strut extended.Disassembly of the shock strut inner cylinder revealed the absence of several parts. The area where these parts are located is a sealed area that was not compromised. This discrepancy allowed a retention nut to back off which resulted in nose gear separation. The nose gear assembly was overhauled on 9 April 1985."
58,ACC948,"A CASA C-212 Aviocar passenger plane, operated by the Peruvian domestic airline Aerochasqui, was destroyed when it crashed shortly after takeoff from Bellavista Airport (BLP), Peru.

74,ACC964,"Hercules 130322, radio call-sign BOXTOP 22, was a scheduled resupply flight from Thule Air Base in Greenland to Canadian Forces station (CFS) Alert, an isolated station on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island. The flight departed Thule on 30 October 1991 at 20:05 UTC (16:05 hours local time), carrying five crew members and 13 passengers, and approximately 18,000 litres of arctic diesel fuel in a large cylindrical aluminum tank. The passengers were seated in a small area directly ahead of this bulk fuel delivery system (BFDS). BOXTOP 22 was the second of three aircraft bound for CFS Alert on the afternoon of 30 October. CF6185, a CC-130 not associated with the BOXTOP operation, was approximately 10 minutes ahead of BOXTOP 22 and BOXTOP 21, another CC-130, was approximately 20 minutes behind. The weather was reported as scattered cloud at 9,000 feet, a thin scattered layer at 18,000 feet and ten miles visibility in light snow. The visibility was such that the crew of BOXTOP 22 could observe the rotating beacon of CF6185 on the CFS Alert runway from approximately 25 miles away. The crew was communicating with the radar operator deployed at Alert for the Boxtop operation. The aircraft commander's original intention was to have the First Officer (FO) fly a Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) approach to runway 29. Believing that there was a potential conflict with the following aircraft, the commander elected, instead, to fly a visual approach to expedite his arrival. The aircraft crashed 10.5 miles southeast of the airport while manoeuvring for the approach. Poor weather, total darkness and rugged terrain were all factors in delaying the arrival of rescue personnel for approximately 32 hours. Four passengers died because of injuries suffered in the crash and the commander succumbed to hypothermia before rescue personnel could arrive on scene."

108,ACC998,"The plane was carrying a cargo of fish (11 060 kg) and one companion from Magadan to Irkutsk. For financial reasons, the crew refused to stopover for refueling at Lensk Airport. Refueling was planned in Bratsk. However, weather conditions in Bratsk forced the crew to fly on to Irkutsk. Knowing they were short on fuel, the flight crew shut down engine no.1, then no.4, and no.2. Engine no. 3 flamed out after running out of fuel.A forced wheels-up landing was carried out, during which the plane broke in two, just aft of the wings."
109,ACC999,Takeoff was aborted at a speed of 230 km/h. The An-12 went off the runway and crashed into a concrete structure. A fire occurred.
110,ACC1000,Inflight fire; damaged beyond repair in forced landing.
111,ACC1001,"The nose gear centralizing cam was damaged when the aircraft was towed up a steep incline. When the oleo extended after takeoff, the nosewheel adopted an off-set position and remained in that position after the gear was extended for landing. On landing the aircraft slewed violently to the left as the nosewheel touched the runway surface. The aircraft left the runway, the gear collapsed, and the aircraft collided with meteorological observation equipment adjacent to the runway."
112,ACC1002,"During take-off from runway 34 at Calgary Airport, the left main cabin door opened. Tower personnel observed an object fall from the door and advised the crew. The aircraft returned and carried out a missed approach on runway 10 before landing safely on runway 16."
113,ACC1003,"China General Aviation Corp. flight 7552, a Yakovlev Yak-42D, was destroyed when it crashed during takeoff from Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport in China. Of the 126 persons on board the flight, 19 survived the accident.The aircraft operated on a scheduled passenger service to Xiamen Airport. During an attempted takeoff from runway 06, the flight failed to rotate, even as the speed increased past Vr speed.The flight crew then attempted to abort the takeoff, but the aircraft overran the runway at high speed. After 420 meters the aircraft crossed a 22 feet wide drainage ditch and impacted a 2 metre high embankment. The aircraft's ground speed at the time was 210 km/h (113 kts). It broke up and caught fire.It was established that the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser was trimmed in the landing configuration. This was not discovered because the crew probably did not perform the pre-flight checklist."
114,ACC1004,"The Tu-134 operated on a passenger flight from Donetsk to Ivanovo. Weather at the destination was poor with a visibility of 1200 m, haze, drizzle, and an overcast at 110 m.The aircraft deviated from the approach procedures and at a distance of 8600 m from the runway the aircraft was at 500 m (instead of 400 m as prescribed) with a lateral deviation of 1900 m to the right at a speed of 390 km/h with flaps and stabilizer not yet configured for final approach. None of the crew members reported the altitude and speed to the commander and the navigator had not given any information to allow the aircraft to align with the runway and glide path. The navigator then suggested the captain to select flaps to 20° and to make a turn to align with the runway. The captain ignored this and continued his approach with performing the necessary actions. While descending through a height of 350 m the GPWS sounded. The flight crew did not react to this warning.At a distance of 4500 m from the runway, the aircraft had a 200300 m lateral deviation from the approach path and had reached a height of 200 m. To reach the landing course, the commander began to turn to the right with a roll of up to 35°. The turn was performed uncoordinated, with the result that the vertical speed increased to 15-16 m/s. The approach continued to be unstabilized and at an altitude of about 80 m the navigator made a last attempt to convince the aircraft commander of the need for a go-around. Two seconds later the captain likely saw trees ahead and attempted a manouvre to avoid a collision.The aircraft struck trees 2962 m from the runway at a speed of 370 km/h and a rate of descent of 6 m/s. At that moment, the plane was 60 meters to the left of the extended runway centreline. The right wing broke up and the aircraft impacted the ground 512 m after the first point of impact.On the ground, a two storey residential house and several non-residential buildings were damaged."
115,ACC1005,"The aircraft had just taken off on an experimental flight when it entered a gradually steepening climb. During the climb the aircraft rolled slowly to the right and, at approximately 200 feet above ground level (agl), it entered a steep nose-down, right-wing-low attitude and crashed. Upon impact, the on-board fuel ignited and the majority of the aircraft wreckage was destroyed by fire. The three crew members aboard the aircraft were fatally injured.The Caribou was the initial aircraft of a modification project by NewCal Aviation that involved the removal of the original Pratt & Whitney R-2000-7M2 piston engines and the installation of Pratt & Whitney PT6A-67R turbo-prop engines and associated equipment. The first flight tests of the modified aircraft began on 16 November 1991. The occurrence flight was intended to be the first of several trips designed to flight-check the fuel and hydraulic systems."
116,ACC1006,"The float-equipped Twin Otter crashed into the jungle 35 yards from the Algodon River when attempting an emergency landing after power loss of the engines. The aircraft had departed Iquitos at 11:25 hours on a flight to El Estrecho, a village on the border with Colombia.The airplane carried the dual military serial FAP304."
117,ACC1007,"On touchdown, white smoke was observed from the left main landing gear wheels. After rolling 2000 feet along the runway, the aircraft veered to the left and at 2400 feet departed the runway entirely. It came to a stop 123 feet from the runway after the nose section had broken through the airport perimeter fence. The left gear collapsed due to failure of the landing gear assembly as a result of the shearing of its castellation.Laboratory observation indicated that the castellation tang had been subjected to force fatigue that could occur during the assembly of the landing gear."

123,ACC1013,"Douglas DC-7B airtanker N848D had been operating from Stockton, CA (SCK) and had made several drops of retardant on the southeast edge of a fire on the El Dorado National Forest.Their first mission on October 1, 1992, had begun at 08:33. Their fourth mission had them departing the base at 11:56. Their departure was immediately followed by a Lockheed SP2H enroute to the same fire. The DC-7B arrived in the fire vicinity at an elevation of about 6,500 feet MSL at 12:20. Air attack briefed the DC-7Bs two-person flight crew for their retardant drop. Air attack was flying at approximately 7,500 feet MSL. The planned drop was to be made from north to south about one mile west of the upper dam on the reservoir. It was to be the airtankers first drop in this particular location. The visibility was good, in excess of ten miles, and turbulence was reported as mild, but bumpy. The area over the lake to the east of the drop pattern was experiencing reduced visibility due to smoke.According to occupants of the second airtanker, the DC-7B made a turn around the fire and was descending northbound for a drop out of a right hand pattern when the DC-7B captain indicated that he wanted to depart the pattern as he had a problem with an engine. He suggested the second airtanker perform the intended drop while he worked with his engine problem. The second airtanker then received attention from air attack and began a circle to fly a pattern similar to the pattern the DC-7B had flown.Shortly thereafter, air attack asked the DC-7B if he needed to abort (drop) his load of retardant. That captain replied that he might have to if he couldnt solve his engine problem. All communications were normal. Air attack was operating without leadplane assistance as the leadplane had departed the scene for fuel a few minutes before, instructing air attack to perform drops on the west side of the reservoir. Another leadplane was about six minutes out.The mishap airtanker was reported to be descending at about 6,000 feet MSL heading in a north-northwesterly direction after departing the drop pattern, with no visible signs of engine problems and no indication of concern present in his radio transmissions. The DC-7B continued northbound toward gently rising terrain about two miles from the intended drop site and was next observed heading in an easterly direction and low to the ground. The airtanker was reported to be in a sharply pitched up attitude prior to dropping its retardant. Air attack reported that he observed the retardant start and stop, but did not know if a full load had been dropped. He said the load was continuous. The DC-7B was then reported to fall off on the right wing as it descended steeply toward the ground. During this sequence, the captain transmitted on the radio, ""Were going in, were going in.""It was at this point that tree strikes occurred which removed the horizontal stabilizers and elevators from the tail of the airtanker. This entire sequence took place within the span of about 60 seconds. The airtanker then went behind a ridge and white smoke was observed rising from the site. The airtanker had impacted the ground in steep terrain at an elevation of approximately 5,100 feet MSL. Some of the wreckage was deposited in a creek bottom and the remainder was located on an adjacent south-facing slope. Both the captain and copilot were fatally injured. The aircraft was totally destroyed."
124,ACC1014,"The aircraft departed Dayton, Ohio on a flight to San Jose, California. While in cruise flight at Flight Level 310, 20 miles west of Denver, Colorado, the flight encountered severe clear air turbulence which caused major fluctuations in speed and oscillations in both pitch and roll. During these departures from controlled flight, the number one engine and 5.79 m (19 feet) of the leading edge of the left wing separated from the aircraft. In addition, the number four engine pylon cracked and experienced substantial structural damage. The flight conducted a precautionary descent and landed at Stapleton International Airport, Denver, Colorado. Preceding the occurrence, the flight was encountering light to occasionally moderate chop, with moderate to severe turbulence forecast."
125,ACC1015,The pilot of the Islander lost control in a tight turn after takeoff. The engine probably failed and the aircraft was operated at a weight over the MTOW.
126,ACC1016,"A Volpar Turboliner II, a stretched turbine conversion of a Beechcraft C-45 Expeditor, crashed during the approach to Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Maryland. The pilot was killed.The airplane operated on a cargo flight from Dayton, Ohio. Prior to departure, the pilot supervised the loading of the airplane. The plane was loaded to a gross weight of 11,979 lb with the cg 2.7 inches behind the aft limit. At the destination, the flight was vectored for an ILS runway 10 approach. About 3 miles from the runway, the pilot was told to make a missed approach due to inadequate separation from traffic. The pilot acknowledged, but soon thereafter, radar contact with the plane was lost. Witnesses saw the plane descend from a low cloud layer before it crashed. There was evidence the plane impacted in a flat attitude with little forward movement. Four cargo straps were found loose with no sign of tensile overload; 3 others and a restraining board were found loose as if they had not been used. No preimpact mechanical problem was found."
127,ACC1017,"The Fokker F-27 Friendship struck a high ground while on preparing for an approach to runway 36 at Goma Airport. The flight crew descended prematurely and impacted terrain at 8800 feet near the Nkubi intersection, at a point where the approach procedure demanded a passage at FL150."
128,ACC1018,"A Dornier 328 prototype was conducting a test flight to prove compliance with JAR 25.177. The aircraft was flown at FL150 with a 25 degree flap setting, landing gear down and at a speed of 1.13 times the stall speed. At the end of this manoeuvre, the aircraft reached a 20 degree yaw angle. The pilot then experienced a partial buffet on the tail and the Dornier then rolled steep nose down. The pilot instructed the co-pilot in German to reduce the engine power. This was not understood by the U.S. test pilot. Shortly afterwards all six blades of the left engine separated instantaneously when the aircraft passed an inverted position.The fuselage was severely damaged by subsequent propeller strike. The aircraft landed safely."
129,ACC1019,"The aircraft departed Southend at 06:59 UTC, about one hour before sunrise, on a Special VFR clearance. The aircraft flew to Wallasey via Daventry, White gate and the Liverpool Special Rules Zone at 2,400 feet. It could not be determined why the commander chose to fly this route however, some two weeks before the accident he had spent a short holiday at Haverigg which is close to the direct track from Wallasey to Glasgow.On leaving Wallasey, the aircraft tracked north towards Glasgow and, at 08:01 hrs, the crew called Warton aerodrome stating that they were descending to 1,000 feet and requesting a 'Radar Service'.At 08:10 hrs, an aircraft that had just taken off from Blackpool reported a cloud base of between 2,500 and 3,000 feet and a visibility greater than 20 km. At this time the radar transponder on the aircraft was operating but the height encoding facility had not been selected. Recordings of the Great Dunn Fell and the St Anne's ATC radar heads indicated that the aircraft had left Wallasey on a track of 007°M which was maintained until radar contact was lost at 08:13 hrs at a position one mile to the south west of Walney Island airfield near Barrow in Furness. Consideration of the obscuration due to terrain between the radar heads and the aircraft indicated that, at the time of loss of radar contact, the aircraft would have been no higher than 350 feet amsl and possibly lower.At 08:09 hrs, the time of local sunrise, the crew had called Walney Island stating that they were nine miles south of the airfield at 1,000 feet and requesting overflight of the airfield. At 08:12 hrs, the controller at Walney Island sighted the aircraft abeam the airfield at an estimated height of 800 feet and asked the crew to report at Millom which is about eight miles north of Walney Island. At about the same time, a witness on the beach near the airfield saw the aircraft heading north in and out of cloud at a height estimated to be not above 400 feet. The aircraft did not make the requested position report at Millom and, at 08:16 hrs, the controller advised the crew to call London Information for further service. There was no reply to this call. The last person to see the aircraft reported that it was flying steadily north towards Ponsonby Fell and that the cloud in the area of the Fell was covering the ground at 500 feet above sea level. At about 08:15 hrs a farmer, who was some 600 metres from the crash site, heard a bang from the direction of Ponsonby Fell. He stated that at the time that he heard the bang the weather was very bad with a strong wind, rain and mist covering the fell.The aircraft had flown into ground about 15 metres below the top of Ponsonby Fell."

138,ACC1028,"A Britten-Norman BN-2A Islander passenger plane sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at Great Barrier Island Airport (GBZ), New Zealand. The six occupants were not injured.ZK-FVD, operated by Great Barrier Airlines, was being flown on a scheduled passenger service (flight GB 1) between Auckland International Airport and Great Barrier (Claris) Aerodrome.Prior to descent, the pilot checked the brakes and found that the left brake pedal was ""soft""; pumping the brake pedal did not restore it to normal. No abnormality had been noticed during taxiing at Auckland. The pilot briefly considered the possibility of returning to Auckland (where the problem could have been rectified), but decided that this was unnecessary and that a landing could be accomplished safely at Great Barrier. However, the possibility of a rejected takeoff on departure from Great Barrier, requiring serviceable brakes, was not considered.The runways available at Great Barrier were 06/24, with a total length of 620 m, and 10/28, with a totallength of 930 m. On runways 06 and 10 there were displaced landing thresholds of 22 m and 60 m respectively.Arriving in the circuit area at Great Barrier, the pilot carried out a standard circuit joining procedure, and observing the wind to be blowing from about 190 degrees magnetic at less than 10 knots, elected to use runway 10.The pilot stated that she chose runway 10 because the location of the aircraft parking area in relation to the runway would require only right-hand turns during taxiing, minimising the need for use of the left brake.However, ZK-FVD was equipped with nosewheel steering and this, combined with the use of asymmetric power during ground manoeuvring, should have allowed the pilot to taxi without difficulty.The pilot made a normal approach, but was aiming to utilise the maximum runway length, including that prior to the 60 m displaced landing threshold on this runway. As she flared the aircraft for touchdown, she felt a solid bump, ""like a heavy landing"".Both pairs of main undercarriage wheels had contacted the lip of the drainage ditch at the runway threshold, tearing the left leg from its attachment points and damaging the right one substantially.As the aircraft lost flying speed, it settled onto its belly and left wingtip, and began to veer towards the left side of the strip. The pilot attempted to maintain directional control using right rudder and brake, but without success. The aircraft came to rest in the manuka scrub beside the strip, 260 m from the point of first ground contact."
139,ACC1029,"Flight 102 departed Honolulu at 17:53 local time for a 7 hour flight to Dallas. The weather report received by the flight at 06:44 (15 minutes before landing) stated a.o.: ceiling 1400 feet overcast, 2,5 miles visibility, thunderstorms and rain showers. The flight was cleared for a runway 17L approach about 5 minutes later and the captain asked the approach controller for the best heading in order to avoid bad weather along the approach path. The crew were advised to turn right heading 220 deg and intercept the runway 17L localizer.At 06:56 the aircraft was cleared to land. On short finals the aircraft was in about a 10 degree right crab due to crosswind. At 06:59, while descending through 50 feet, the 1st officer intended to perform a go-around. The captain stated ""No, no, no, I got it"" and took control. The aircraft touched down at 06:59:29 and drifted to the right, off the runway. The DC-10 finally came to rest in the mud with the nose- and left main gear collapsed."

149,ACC1039,"A Royal Swazi National Airways Corporation Fokker F-28 aircraft, en route from Maputo (MPM), Mozambique, to Manzini (MTS), Eswatini, carrying two passengers and four crew members, was hijacked by a Mozambican who was armed with an AK-47 assault rifle and who demanded to be taken to Australia. When the pilot informed the hijacker that Australia was beyond the aircraft's flying range, the hijacker demanded to fly to Lesotho but later redirected the flight to Johannesburg, South Africa, where the aircraft was to be refueled and flown to Mauritius.While the aircraft was in flight, the hijacker, who was intoxicated, fired three shots and struck the pilot and copilot with the butt of his rifle. When the aircraft landed at Jan Smuts International Airport in Johannesburg, the hijacker released two crew members. After two hours of negotiating with the hijacker, security forces stormed the aircraft and in the exchange of gunfire the hijacker, pilot, and a passenger were wounded. The hijacker, wanted by authorities for the murders of two policemen, reportedly smuggled his rifle aboard the aircraft in a large shoulder bag."
150,ACC1040,"An inflight fire shortly after takeoff forced the crew to return to the airport for an emergency landing. The airplane descended fast, crashing into a forest at a distance of 3400 m from the runway and 480 meters to the left of the extended centreline.The fire in the aft cabin led to an explosion of ammunition. The result was the destruction of the elevator rod and the loss of longitudinal control. The cause of the fire has not been established."
151,ACC1041,"The aircraft touched down about halfway down the 3,600 ft, sand/clay runway.

The plane was on a regular weekly flight transporting patients needing specialized or urgent medical care to the capital of Khuzenstan Province. National Iranian Oil Company employees were also on the flight. The aircraft initially headed for Kuwait but was refused permission to land. Only after a fuel emergency was declared was the plane allowed to land in Basra, Iraq. There are conflicting reports as to the identity of the hijacker.One report identified him as an Iranian seeking political asylum for himself, his wife, and his five children."
171,ACC1061,"A Cessna 650, N700RR, collided with a cement pad while taxiing back to the taxiway in the grass, collapsing the nose gear. The flight originated from Morristown, New Jersey, about 2 hours 15 minutes before the accident. The pilot-in-command stated that after landing the airplane started to weather vane while transitioning to a taxiway. Nosewheel steering was initiated with negative results. Full power was applied on the thrust reversers and the airplane departed the taxiway and came to a stop in the grass. The pilot-in-command evaluated the situation and started to taxi forward. The airplane rolled forward about 10 to 15 feet and the nose gear collapsed. Examination of the airplane revealed the left hand main gear assembly trailing link connectors, antiskid transducers were crossed, and responded opposite of how they should have operated."
172,ACC1062,"The two pilots were transporting Hydro-Québec employees from Kuujjuarapik to Umiujaq. The flight departed at 14:44. Thirty miles from Umiujaq, the crew commenced the descent. Seven miles from the village, the aircraft was at an altitude of 700 feet and the crew could see the ground. The crew used a GPS waypoint to supplement visual navigation and continued their step-down procedure to about 200 feet agl. When turning onto the final approach to runway 21, the pilot-in-command initiated a turn with at least 35 degrees of bank angle, and the aircraft stalled. The pilot-in-command initiated a stall recovery and called for full power. The aircraft did not gain sufficient altitude to overfly the rising terrain, and it crashed."
173,ACC1063,"The pilot took off from runway 09 at Tuktoyaktuk at 17:06:34, and had turned the aircraft to a southerly direction when the right engine lost all power. He decided to return to the airport. While manoeuvring back to the airport, the aircraft struck an ice-covered lake in a steep, 65 degrees nose-down attitude. The engines and front of the aircraft penetrated the approximately two-foot-thick layer of ice. The remainder of the fuselage, wings, and empennage remained on the ice surface."

182,ACC1072,"During towing, when making a 180 degree turn on the runway with a radius less than that permitted, the aircraft and the towing vehicle collided. The reason for the collision was uncoordinated action by the towing team and the pilot and violation of the operator's procedures for towing."
183,ACC1073,"While circling to land on runway 26, the crew performed a non-typical circling procedure at a lower than published altitude, leading to loss of control consistent with an accelerated stall, and descended into terrain. Whiteout conditions may have contributed."
184,ACC1074,"The An-24 veered right during takeoff and ran into a 1,2 m high mound of packed snow. A 60 m wide part of the runway had been cleared from snow; mounds of snow along the cleared strip were hiding the runway lights and edge markings. The runway surface however was uneven with different thicknesses of packed snow."
185,ACC1075,During landing the aircraft deviated to the right of the runway and landed on unpacked snow.When the landing lights were switched on the reflection caused the crew to lose visual contact with the runway. The aircraft touched down on snow-covered ground 53 m from the runway centreline and bounced several times. The engine caught fire and the gear and fuselage were damaged from the impact. The crew did not follow ATC's recommendation to divert to an airport with better weather. The remaining fuel would have allowed a diversion.
186,ACC1076,"On approach to Nalchik the flaps were set to 35 deg. The nose suddenly pitched up and down; control was lost and the An-12 crashed 4,5 km short of the runway. The aircraft was carrying a cargo of coins (13,5 t.) from St. Petersburg to Nalchik via Volgograd."

189,ACC1079,"The aircraft departed Bankstown Airport, NSW (BWU) at about 06:40 and proceeded as planned to Inverell Airport, NSW (IVR) with several en route stops. At Inverell the pilot rested until his departure that afternoon for the return journey. At 17:23 the pilot departed Armidale (ARM) for Tamworth (TMW). The planned time for the flight was 17 minutes. The flight plan indicated the flight would be conducted in accordance with IFR procedures. The pilot elected to remain at 4,500 ft in visual meteorological conditions because of conflicting traffic at higher altitudes. The published IFR lowest safe altitude for the route was 5,400 ft.At about 17:32 the pilot requested a descent clearance. He was cleared to make a visual approach with a clearance limit of 5 NM DME from Tamworth, and was requested to report at 8 DME from Tamworth. The pilot acknowledged the instructions and reported leaving 4,500 ft on descent.The aircraft was 8.2 NM from Tamworth when it impacted trees at approximately 2,685 ft AMSL. It was descending at an angle of approximately 3.5 degrees, and was banked about 17.5 degrees to the left at impact. The aircraft maintained a straight path after initial impact but had rolled to a bank angle of 25 degrees left by the time the left wing struck a second tree 35 m further on. It then impacted the ground left wing low and inverted, before bouncing into a rock face 200 m from initial impact. The main fuselage wreckage caught fire and the cabin area was destroyed.There was low cloud and rain in the area at the time of the accident."
190,ACC1080,"The crew had arrived in Key West Harbor with 13 passengers about 10:10, and had disembarked the passengers. The crew moored the airplane and had gone ashore. The crew returned to the airplane about 11:30, and were planning on a short flight to Key West Airport for the purpose of refueling. The first officer was the pilot flying, and the checklist for start, run-up, and takeoff was partially accomplished. Shortly after liftoff the airplane was observed by witnesses to pitch up abruptly. The captain, and first officer noted the nose pitching up, and the captain stated that they ""might have a lot of water in the tail"", and the first officer then stated ""a lot of water"". The crew was then heard to attempt to overcome the nose up pitch until impact."
191,ACC1081,"On February 21, 1994, the right engine of N3433Y experienced a misfire and loss of power while on final approach to Spokane, WA. The airplane was grounded for maintenance and the right engine was removed and replaced with an overhauled engine from Precision Airmotive. Precision Airmotive reported that the overhaul was completed and approved for service on December 20, 1993 and preserved for short term storage. Prior to the overhaul the engine had been on the shelf in long term storage. At the time of the accident, the operator reported that the engine had accumulated a total time of 15 hours since the overhaul. On March 18, 01:53 hours, the captain reported to the Spokane controller that the flight was ready for takeoff on runway 21. The controller instructed the flight to, after takeoff, fly a heading of 215 degrees to Portland, and it was cleared for takeoff. Shortly after takeoff the crew were forced to shut down the right engine because of a failure. They tried to return to the airport but the plane collided with the terrain in an open level field located 3,450 feet from the end of runway 21 and 900 feet to the right of runway centerline. The airplane was lying on its belly, with the main landing gear retracted. The entire fuselage and cargo, cockpit, and inboard section of both wings was consumed by fire."

193,ACC1083,"A Canadair Challenger 601-3A, N88HA, operating as a positioning flight after passenger drop off, experienced a dual engine flameout during cruise flight between FL370 and FL410 in the vicinity of Bassett, Nebraska. The airplane sustained substantial damage during the subsequent forced landing in an alfalfa field. The two commercial pilots received serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, an IFR flight plan was in effect. The airplane departed Burlington, Vermont approximately 21:28, with an intended destination of Long Beach, California.The flight crew departed their home base of Long Beach, California (LGB) at 10:28, and flew to San Diego, California (SAN). They picked up two passengers and a flight attendant and departed for Boston's Logan Airport (BOS), Massachusetts. The flight arrived at BOS at 17:28 and the passengers and flight attendant deplaned. The airplane departed BOS at 18:07 with only flight crew on board. They flew to Lawrence Municipal Airport (LWM), Massachusetts where they had prearranged a ""quick turnaround"" fuel stop for the trip back to LGB. The airplane landed at LWM at 18:14 with 3,000 pounds of Jet A fuel on board, and the flight crew planned to take on an additional 12,500 pounds of fuel. The contracted Fixed Base Operator (FBO) at LWM, pumped about 221 US gallons into the airplane before the fuel truck stopped pumping. Attempts to revive the fuel truck were unsuccessful. Approximately two hours after they arrived at LWM, the flight crew decided to fly to Burlington, Vermont (BVT) to pick up the remainder of the required fuel load. As the flight crew taxied the airplane to the active runway for departure, the FBO manager radioed them to report he found water in the bottom of the fuel truck, and wanted to check for contamination in the airplane. The pilots stated although they believed any water in the fuel would be dispersed due to movement on rough taxiways and motive flow fuel system, they parked the airplane to draw fuel samples. The FBO Manager drove to meet the airplane with a general aviation type (3 to 4 ounce) fuel strainer, and fuel samples were drawn from several drain points across the airplane. Small amounts of water were found at the belly drain points; the sampling continued until clear samples were obtained. The flight crew departed for BVT about 20:19 and arrived there approximately 20:53. They stated the flight to BVT was uneventful except for observed auxiliary tank fuel quantity gauge and fuel totalizer fluctuations. The flight crew reported as a precautionary measure they elected to top the airplane off at BVT. The fuel tanks were drained again after fueling at BVT, with no evidence of water contamination. The flight crew departed BVT approximately 21:28. The pilots reported during the flight the IMPENDING FILTER BYPASS warning light for the left engine illuminated. They monitored other engine indications in accordance with the flight manual, and continued en route to LGB with the warning light illuminated. The pilots stated the airplane was established in cruise flight at 41,000 feet, approximately 2 1/2 hours into the flight, when the warning light went out. Shortly thereafter, the fuel LOW PRESS and fuel boost pump ""ON"" lights for the left engine began to flash on and off. At 00:14, the pilots initiated a descent as the left engine began to spool down. They selected CONTINUOUS IGNITION and left engine power was restored temporarily. Approximately 00:16 the left engine lost power again. The flight crew contacted Air Traffic Control (ATC) to request a lower altitude in order to attempt engine restart within the restart envelope. The pilots stated a few minutes later, as the airplane descended through approximately 37,000 feet, the right engine lost power with no observed warning lights or indications.The pilots stated they lost all electrical power (except center panel emergency instruments) with the loss of power on both engines. They manually deployed the Air-Driven Generator (ADG) and recovered power for pilot's side instruments, radios and 3B hydraulic pressure. The right seat pilot declared ""MAYDAY"", reported the loss of both engines and requested ATC vectors to the nearest airport. ATC advised the flight crew of several airports in the area, and the crew chose the closest, the Rock County Airport (RBE), in Bassett, Nebraska, for their emergency approach and landing. The pilots reported throughout the emergency the left seat pilot flew the airplane and looked for the airport, while the right seat pilot worked the radios and attempted restarts on both engines and the APU. The flying pilot stated he set up a glide speed of 230 knots which resulted in a descent rate of about 1,500 foot per minute (fpm). He reported he selected the 230 knot airspeed as a compromise to provide the ram air necessary to keep the ADG running, but still maintain a moderate descent rate to allow time to locate the airport/runway and set up for the power off approach. The right seat pilot stated he made 2 to 3 unsuccessful restart attempts on each engine during the emergency descent. He reported he also tried to start the APU about 7 times without success. The right seat pilot also attempted to activate the pilot controlled runway lighting system at without success. The flying pilot reported when the airplane broke out of the overcast, he was able to locate the airport's rotating beacon, but didn't see the runway. He set the airplane up in a descending spiral above the airport and kept looking for the runway. The flying pilot stated when he finally saw the runway, he felt the airplane was too low to make a successful approach and landing. The pilots stated it was so dark they couldn't see anything, so they decided to keep the wings level and land straight ahead. The airplane impacted terrain in an alfalfa field about one mile northwest of the airport.The airplane collided with a barbed wire fence, a cedar tree windbreak and the free end of a center pivot irrigation rig during the impact sequence."

195,ACC1085,"On the day before the accident, the Islander aircraft flew from Aurukun to Weipa with the chief pilot occupying the left pilot seat and the pilot involved in the accident occupying the right pilot seat. At Weipa the chief pilot left the aircraft,instructing the other pilot to fly some practice circuits before returning the aircraft to Aurukun. Before commencing the circuits and the return flight to Aurukun, the aircraft's two main tanks each contained 100 L of fuel and the two wing tip tanks each contained about 90 L of fuel.On the day of the accident the pilot added 200 L of fuel at Aurukun to the aircraft's tanks and then flew the aircraft and the passengers to Weipa. About 50 minutes before sunset, the aircraft taxied for departure from runway 30 for the 25-minute return flight to Aurukun.When the aircraft was about 300 ft above ground level after takeoff, a witness reported that all engine sounds stopped and that the aircraft attitude changed from a nose-high climb to a more level attitude. A short time later, the noise of engine power surging was heard. The aircraft rolled left and entered a spiral descent. It struck level ground some 350 m beyond the departure end of runway 30 and 175 m to the left of the extended centreline."

197,ACC1087,"Rwanda's president, Juvénal Habyarimana, and Burundian president, Cyprien Ntaryamira, were killed when the Falcon 50 corporate jet crashed after being hit by a missile while on final approach to Kigali. Both presidents were returning from a meeting in Tanzania to consider ways to implement an agreement setting up a transitional government in Rwanda, intended to be in place until multi-party elections could be held. This meant that power would be shared between the Hutu population of Rwanda and the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Hutu extremist members of the presidents inner circle viewed the agreement as an existential threat to a Hutu-dominated Rwanda as well as their own political and economic standing. These men were not simply opposed to a reconciliation process; they were committed to the wholesale extermination of Tutsis.One of these men was Théoneste Bagosora. Colonel Bagosora was intimately familiar with the presidents travel schedule and sufficiently powerful that the night before the summit, he was able to change the composition of the Rwandan delegation to ensure that Army Chief of Staff General Déogratias Nsabimana -who opposed Bagosoras genocidal plans- would be on the president's plane.Using a proprietary radio network, Bagosora was in direct contact with elements of the presidential guard, the para­commando battalion, and most importantly, the Anti­Aircraft Battalion (LAA). These units were located in Kanombe Camp, near Kanombe International Airport in Kigali.The LAA, which Bagosora personally commanded for several years, was not only responsible for the security of the airport, but had anti-aircraft weapons stationed in the immediate vicinity.Through their private communication channel, the conspirators tracked the progress of the president's Falcon 50 aircraft from the moment it left Dar es Salaam to return to Kigali. As it flew west toward the airport, the conspirators fired two SAMs from an area just east of the runway and toward the northern part of Kanombe Camp. At least one of the missiles struck the left wing and fuselage, causing the plane to crash into the grounds of the president's Kanombe residence.The death of Hutu President Habyarimana triggered a massive wave of genocide in Rwanda that finally ended in July 1994."
198,ACC1088,"A FedEx employee was due to be fired for lying on his résumé about his previous flying experience with the United States Navy. He took a jump seat on a regular flight from Memphis (MEM) to San Jose (SJC). He was intending to murder the flight crew with hammers and then to use the aircraft for a kamikaze attack on FedEx Headquarters in Memphis. He attacked just minutes after takeoff, brutally wounded the flight crew with hammers and fractured the skull of the first officer. A lengthy struggle ensued with the flight engineer and captain. The first officer managed to control the plane as the three others struggled in the cockpit.By means of extreme aerial manoeuvres meant to keep the attacker off balance, the flight crew eventually succeeded in restraining him. The DC-10 landed safely at Memphis International Airport despite the plane's being loaded with fuel and too heavy to land under normal circumstances."
199,ACC1089,"The Caravan departed Itaituba (ITB) at 06:40 on a flight to Jacareacanga (JCR). Jacareacanga Radio was contacted five minutes later. The crew were informed that visibility was poor: ceiling at 0 feet with a visibility of 300 meters, which was below minimums. The Caravan circled the airport to wait for the weather to improve. At 07:37 Jacareacanga Radio tried to contact the flight, but no answer was received. It appeared that the airplane had flown into the ground.Investigation revealed that the pilot was underqualified. The flight was being operated as an air taxi flight, which meant that it had to be piloted by an ATPL pilot. The pilot however just had a PPL and did not have an IFR rating."

Visibility at the airport was limited, so the controller instructed the flight to carry out an instrument approach. The flight crew however insisted in attempting a visual approach to runway 02. This approach was abandoned due to limited visibility. The pilot then executed a right-hand procedural turn to attempt another approach to runway 02. This approach was abandoned as well. The pilot now attempted to visually line up with runway 20 by making a left-hand turn. This was contrary to the approach procedures at Uruapan. The aircraft then impacted a mountain at 3937 ft (1200 m).Weather at Uruapan was reported as: visibility 4nm; half cloudy ceiling at 800 ft; clouds at 1200 feet and overcast at 2000 feet."

202,ACC1092,"Buffalo Air Flight 526, a Douglas DC-3C freighter based in Yellowknife, was hauling jet fuel to Trout Lake from Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, in support of forest fire suppression operations.Before the departure from Yellowknife to Trout Lake, the flight crew checked the en route weather and filed a company flight itinerary. Dispatch issued the flight crew an aircraft-fuel-load receipt which indicated that the aircraft had been fuelled the night before with a total fuel quantity of about 436 imperial gallons (imp. gal.): full main tanks (336 imp. gal.), and 50 gallons in each auxiliary tank (100 imp. gal.). The first officer confirmed this quantity with a fuel dip-stick borrowed from the refueller.At 07:40 mountain daylight saving time, the flight crew departed Yellowknife in accordance with visual flight rules (VFR). On board the aircraft were 17 full 45-imperial-gallon drums of Turbo-B jet fuel.At 09:25 the aircraft landed at Trout Lake, and the 17 drums of jet fuel were off-loaded; the aircraft then departed for Fort Simpson at 0945. The 82-nautical-mile (nm) flight to Fort Simpson was flown at an altitude of about 2,500 feet above sea level (asl); the flight crew reported encountering light headwinds.At 10:20 the aircraft landed at Fort Simpson. Once again 17 drums of jet fuel were loaded on board, then the aircraft departed at 10:49. The captain climbed the aircraft to an altitude of 3,500 feet asl. After he levelled off the aircraft, the captain adjusted the engines to 575 brake horsepower (bhp) settings.At 11:20, the aircraft landed at Trout Lake and the drums were off-loaded, and at 11:35 the aircraft was once again airborne on the second round-trip shuttle flight.Thirty-five minutes later the aircraft landed at Fort Simpson. While the cargo was being loaded on the aircraft, the flight crew discussed their different calculations regarding the aircraft's fuel quantity. The first officer indicated that the aircraft required fuel. The captain calculated that the aircraft had sufficient fuel remaining. The captain decided that they would refuel at Fort Simpson on the next shuttle flight; nonetheless, since the flight crew considered the cockpit fuel gauges unreliable, the captain requested that the first officer confirm the fuel quantity using a dip-stick.At 12:28, the aircraft departed Fort Simpson and climbed to 5,000 feet asl. About eight minutes later, the flight crew noticed that the fuel pressure was fluctuating, indicating that the auxiliary tanks were empty. The captain repositioned the fuel tank selectors to their respective main tanks and enquired about the dip-stick measurements. The first officer responded that he had not checked the fuel quantity because the fuel dip-stick was missing. The crew discussed the fuel quantity remaining and the captain calculated that the aircraft had approximately 45 minutes of fuel remaining.Following the 13:00 touchdown at Trout Lake, the cargo was unloaded and 31 empty fuel drums were loaded on board the aircraft for Fort Simpson.At 13:25 the aircraft departed Trout Lake. The first officer was the pilot flying (PF) the aircraft, and was in the right seat. The captain performed the duties of the pilot not flying (PNF). Twenty miles southwest of Fort Simpson, the PNF reported their position to Fort Simpson Flight Service Station (FSS). He also requested that the aircraft refueller be advised that they would require fuel on arrival. The flight crew then completed the descent checks and, at 10 miles southwest of the airport, the PNF updated FSS of their position and received the airport advisory.Approximately six miles from the airport, at an altitude of about 400 to 500 feet above ground level (agl), the PF advised the PNF that the left engine was losing fuel pressure. Shortly thereafter, the left engine lost power. Immediately, the PNF switched the left fuel boost pump to the ON position, and the left fuel selector from LEFT MAIN to LEFT AUXILIARY tank position. The engine resumed power momentarily, but lost power again. The PNF then switched the left fuel selector to the RIGHT AUXILIARY tank position and the engine regained power; however, it promptly lost power again.Realizing that the fuel had been depleted in three of the four tanks, the captain took control of the aircraft and headed straight for runway 31. As the captain called for the engine failure check for the left engine, the first officer advised the captain that the right engine was losing power. With a loss of power in both engines, and without sufficient altitude to glide to the airport, the first officer called the Fort Simpson FSS to advise that the flight crew would attempt a landing on the road (Mackenzie Highway) north of the Liard River. However, the approach to the road was unsuccessful and the aircraft crash-landed into a treed area.At about 14:03, several witnesses at the Liard River ferry crossing observed the aircraft flying low in a northwesterly direction. The aircraft was estimated to be at about 40 feet agl when it crossed overhead the ferry terminal and was descending. The witnesses reported that they heard the sound of the engines cutting in and out before the aircraft passed overhead their vantage points. They also reported seeing the landing gear being extended. The aircraft then disappeared from view behind the trees.Immediately thereafter, the aircraft struck trees near the road, and crashed about 1/2 nm short of runway 31. The aircraft had been flown for approximately 4 hours and 37 minutes since its last refuelling."
203,ACC1093,"Blowing sand at the destination Tidjikja forced the crew to abandon earlier attempts to land. The aircraft touched down heavily, causing the undercarriage to fail. The F-28 slid off the side of the runway until bursting into flames when it struck a rock outcrop."
204,ACC1094,"The flight crew were faced with no. 1 engine problems on final approach. The approach was continued, but poor alignment with the runway forced the crew to go-around. The no. 2 engine was set at full power and gear and flaps were retracted, but the aircraft continued to lose height. A turn was made to avoid a river and the F-27 touched down in a paddy failed. The aircraft slid for 300 m before colliding with a tree."
205,ACC1095,"A Learjet 35, N69PS, sustained substantial damage during an aborted takeoff at the Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey. There were no injuries. The airplane was destined for Newark, New Jersey. The crew taxied to and was cleared for takeoff on runway 13, which was 10,000 feet long and 180 feet wide.The pilot in command said that during takeoff, the airplane 'pulled' left before reaching V1 (takeoff decision speed) and he had difficulty maintaining directional control. He initiated an abort, but could not stop on the remaining runway. The plane crossed a concrete slab that previously supported an approach light and the main gear collapsed. The plane stopped 446 feet from the departure end of the runway. The outer left tire had blown during the takeoff roll, followed by the left inner tire and both right main tires. The pilot in command was unable to obtain reverse thrust because the reversers were not armed before takeoff. This was not included on the checklist that was provided to the flightcrew. Also, the pilot in command did not deploy the drag chute.Company maintenance personnel indicated the tires had been under-inflated when they were built up and installed, several days before the accident and that the tires had not been checked or reinflated after buildup."
206,ACC1096,The Lockheed P2V-7 air tanker crashed after dropping a partial load of retardant on the Butler Creek Fire. The crew apparently became fixated on the malfunction of the retardant-release doors and did not realize the tanker was entering a narrow box canyon. The airplane struck steeply rising terrain below the ridge top.
207,ACC1097,The aircraft was reportedly shot down and crashed in a forest near Saborsko.
208,ACC1098,"The Antonov 12 transport plane operated on a flight from Chita to Domna, Russia. While on the leg between Dzhida and Bada the flight encountered below-minima weather conditions. Poor visibility at Bada caused the flight to deviate from the approach pattern and glide path. The airplane impacted a hilltop at 140 metres, some 5,200 metres before the runway threshold and 430 metres to the right of the extended centreline of the runway."
209,ACC1099,"A Canadair CRJ-100LR, N403SW, collided with a tug after pushback at the Burbank Airport, California. N403SW was operating as SkyWest Airlines flight 5967, a scheduled domestic passenger flight to Salt Lake City, Utah. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. There were no injuries to the 33 passengers, 3 crewmembers, and 4 ground personnel.After pushback ground personnel gave the pilots hand signals to set the parking brake. Headsets were not made available for communication with the flightcrew and the light condition was dark. After giving the brake signal twice, the tow bar was disconnected. The airplane rolled forward and impacted the tug. The tug operator reported that the pilots were not clearly visible because of glare from the cockpit window and poor lighting.The pilots stated that they were monitoring engine indications following the completion of engine start. They did not see the tug operator's brake signal. No signal to disconnect was given by the captain or first officer.According to Skywest Airlines Regional Jet Pushback Procedures, dated April 1, 1994: ""Ground crew interphone will be used for all ground/cockpit communications. If the interphone is inoperative, hand signals will be used. Once pushback has ceased, the ground crew will instruct the crew over the interphone or by hand signals to set the parking brake. Once the tow bar and interphone cable has been disconnected, the torque link reconnected, and the tug and towbar are at a safe distance, the ground crew will signal with a departure salute that the aircraft is clear to taxi. The captain will acknowledge by returning the salute."""
210,ACC1100,"An Alyemda aircraft on a domestic flight from Aden to San'a was hijacked by a Yemeni man with a hand grenade. As the aircraft landed at San'a, the hijacker attempted to enter the flight deck of the Boeing 737 aircraft. He demanded to be flown to another location, reportedly Saudi Arabia. Security personnel, who had entered the aircraft through a rear door, overpowered and arrested the hijacker. There were no injuries to the 80 passengers and crew."
211,ACC1101,"The Twin Otter took off from Fish Egg Inlet logging camp for a 16nm VFR flight to Pruth Bay. The aircraft climbed though 100 feet, and just as the flaps were retracting, a violent pitch up was experienced. The aircraft stalled, crashed into the water 100 feet offshore and sank immediately."
212,ACC1102,"On September 22, 1994, a Purus Aerotaxi Embraer Bandeirante landed at Feijó Airport (FEJ). Upon landing the copilot inadvertently mishandled the engines. Reverse pitch was not applied. Directional control was lost and the left main landing gear ran off the side of the runway. The airplane came to rest 40 m past the end of the runway. It was towed to the ramp and the captain performed an inspection of the plane. He notified his company base and decided to continue to Tarauacá (TRQ) and Rio Branco (RBR). The first stretch was a short 10-minute flight, which was to be flown with the landing gear down as a precaution.The aircraft took off from Feijó at 06:30, carrying a load of 635 kg. A couple of minutes after takeoff the no. 2 engine developed problems. Altitude could not be maintained and the aircraft descended towards some trees. To diminish the drag, pilot raised the gear, but it was already too late. The right wing tip collided with a tree, ripping off 3,20 meters of the wing. The airplane rolled and crashed inverted."
213,ACC1103,"The aircraft wasn't able to land at Tura due to bad weather there. After three missed approaches, the crew changed course to Vanavara, the alternate at 450 km SSE of Tura. At 41 km NNW of Vanavara (3,5 hours after leaving Krasnoyarsk), the three engines ran down. A forced landing was attempted on River Chamba, but the aircraft struck the river bank and crashed."
214,ACC1104,"The Antonov failed to get airborne on takeoff, overran by 2250 metres and crashed into a ravine.PROBABLE CAUSE: Locked elevators."
215,ACC1105,"After take-off from Vorkuta at a height of 200 metres an incomplete retraction of the end flaps and slats occurred and shortly afterwards a warning signal to check the hydraulic system was received in the cockpit so the commander decided to turn back to the airport. During the approach the nose and main landing gear were eventually extended and the commander decided to land manually with a clean wing (without flaps and slats, hydraulic boosters or brakes) and apply emergency braking only after landing. The aircraft veered to starboard on the runway and the gear partially collapsed when the aircraft came rest."
216,ACC1106,"Rostov Aviation Enterprises Flight D9-156 was hijacked on October 25, 1994, while en route from Ashgabad, Turkmenistan, to Rostov, Russia, via Makhachkala, Russia. The hijacker claimed to have an explosive device. The pilot reported the incident shortly after the Yakovlev 40 aircraft left Makhachkala following a scheduled intermediate stop. The plane returned to Makhachkala. The hijacker refused to negotiate directly with authorities but used crew members as intermediaries. He demanded USD 2 million and transport to Iran. The hijacked aircraft landed at approximately 22:30. Some passengers were released shortly thereafter; however, additional hostages were not freed until approximately 14:00, October 26. By 18:00 all passengers had been released, and only the hijacker and two or three crew members remained on board. Part of the ransom -USD 800,000- was paid in order to secure the release of these hostages. Shortly after midnight on October 27, they, too, were released. Near dawn, as security forces prepared to storm the aircraft, the hijacker detonated a home-made explosive device and killed himself. Although the plane was damaged, there were no other casualties or injuries. Passengers on the plane reported that the hijacker had a knife, a hand grenade with an exposed fuse, and a home-made explosive device."
217,ACC1107,"During takeoff from Batagay Airport, Russia, the airplane pitched up. The captain turned his head and made gestures to the passengers in the rear to move forward in order to shift the Centre of Gravity.Loosening his grip on the controls allowed the nose to pitch up even further. The airspeed dropped. The pilot then reduced engine power to perform a forced landing but the airplane stalled and impacted terrain. A small fire erupted, but this was quickly contained.It appeared there were four unregistered passengers on the flight, three adults and one child. The baggage weight was underestimated by 139 kg. Calculations concluded that the airplane must have been 503 kg over the allowed maximum takeoff weight with a centre of gravity at 38,2% were a maximum of 33% is allowed."
218,ACC1108,"The hijacker claimed that ten bombs had been placed in various localities around Norway and that they would be detonated if his demands were not met. His main demand was that the Norwegian government should help bring the suffering of the Bosnian people to an end. He demanded, among other things, lifting of the blockade of Sarajevo and Bihac, and that his demands should be made known to the world. The Bosnian stated that the hijacking was a political action, not an act of terrorism. He gave himself up after the police had complied with some of his demands."
219,ACC1109,"The aircraft was destroyed when it flew into the side of a mountain whilst enroute from Nabire to Obana. The point of impact was at the 7,050 ft. level on a ridge line bordering a 5,000ft. mountain pass. At impact the aircraft was apparently in normal level flight. There was a considerable build up of cloud along the western side of the ridge line."
220,ACC1110,"The Yakovlev Yak-40 overran the runway, fell into the bed of the Saposoa River and broke up, killing six of the 31 occupants.The Yak-40 was new to the fleet of Servicios Aéreos Amazonicos and a Ukrainian instructor pilot was in the cockpit along with a copilot and an observer pilot of the airline.The aircraft operated on a domestic flight from Trujillo to Saposoa. Weather at the destination was poor due to rain in the area. On final approach the crew lost sight of the runway. The copilot suggest the initiate a go around, but the captain continued the approach at very low altitude. Noticing the treetops, the copilot advanced the throttles to go around, but the captain intervened and retarded the throttles. The aircraft touched down about half way down the runway on the left-hand edge. The pilot used the thrust reverser and applied the brakes, but these were not effective on the wet runway. The aircraft overran the runway and ended up in the river."
221,ACC1111,"The aircraft performed a transport flight from Voronezh to Kurgan, Krasnoyarsk, Lensk and Susuman. On the last leg of the flight, the aircraft strayed 130 km off course. After running out of fuel, a forced landing was made in forest-tundra terrain."

227,ACC1117,Just before V1 (107 kts) the no. 2 engine auto feathered. The takeoff was aborted and the aircraft overran runway 17 coming to rest against trees 120 m from the runway.
228,ACC1118,"The aircraft was on an ad hoc charter flight from to Durban to attend to an AOG (aircraft on ground) there. While passing the town of Vrede, the aircraft inadvertently entered a thunderstorm, control was lost and the aircraft entered a high speed descent and broke up in flight. The main fuselage fell into the front garden of a house and was completely destroyed. Fortunately nobody on the ground was injured. The tail section was found approximately one kilometer away on a hockey field. There was a post impact fire which also consumed a large portion of the house."
229,ACC1119,"A Chinese man hijacked a Tongyong Airlines Yak-42 aircraft during a domestic flight from Xiamen to Nanking. The plane, with 53 passengers and 11 crew members, was over Fuzhou Province when the incident occurred. The hijacker threatened to ignite a bottle of gasoline unless the plane was diverted to Taiwan. While the plane was en route to Taiwan, the hijacker was knocked down and overpowered by passengers and crew. The aircraft returned to Xiamen, having never entered Taiwanese airspace, and the hijacker was arrested."
230,ACC1120,"The pilot reported that the aircraft engine lost power when he made a power adjustment whilst on final approach. The propeller feathered and the aircraft landed short of the runway on unprepared ground, incurring substantial damage. The aircraft was being used for parachute drops from 14,000ft. When the last parachutist left the aircraft, the pilot would place the aircraft in a steep spiralling descent. During this type of descent, the pilot was known to exceed the 60 degree angle of bank limits for the aircraft. Low fuel states were reported as being used for the paradrops. It is probable that the fuel flow from the wing cells to the collector tank (18 litre capacity) was interrupted during the descent and air entered the system. The fuel pump was not designed to operate in other than a full collector tank. As a result it is likely that the fuel flow to the engine was interrupted, resulting in engine flame out."
231,ACC1121,"The Twin Otter ""Sangihe"" went missing in bad weather whilst operating on a flight (MZ 6715) from Bima to Ruteng. The aircraft is believed to have crashed into the sea."

Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The crew of two and four passengers reported no injuries.Both pilots reported that after the ILS approach the airplane was initially lined up on the centerline of the runway; however, at 20 feet above ground level the airplane drifted off the right side of the landing runway. The captain (flying pilot) attempted to return the airplane to the center of the runway; however, the airplane's left main gear touched down in the snow off the left side of the runway and the airplane exited the runway."
233,ACC1123,"The crew most likely conducted the runway 12 instrument approach to Masset with reference to an unintentionally mis-set altimeter of 30.17 in. Hg, and unknowingly flew the aircraft into the water. The aircraft was on a medevac flight from Vancouver."
234,ACC1124,"On landing, the crew of the Yak-40 steered the aircraft off the right side of the 1600 m snow-covered runway. The aircraft travelled 245 m before colliding with the airport fence.This preventive action was taken because the crew were afraid the plane would overrun and hit an embankment. The aircraft didn't slow down enough due to improper operation of the thrust reversers."
235,ACC1125,"On January 18, just after midnight a light rain started falling on the ramp at Lubbock (LBB) where the airplane N9461R was parked. The temperature was dropping steadily. By 05:19 the precipitation had turned to light rain, light snow, and fog. By 06:25 the rain stopped, and the light snow and fog continued until after the accident.The pilot cleaned snow off the airplane. However, under the snow, 80% of the airplanes wing was covered with a coarse layer of ice from 1/16 inch (1,6 mm) to 3/16 inch (4,8 mm) thickness that was not removed. The airplane departed from runway 35L, intersection Foxtrot, at 09:01. During the instrument departure climbing turn, at 400 feet above the ground, the engine surged and lost power. The aircraft began to lose altitude and the pilot landed in a snow covered flat field of winter wheat. The engine was broken from its mounts and forced under the airplane on the pilot's side and the belly pod was crushed on first impact."
236,ACC1126,"At 19:13 the Let took off from Krasnoyarsk runway 30, weighing approx. 250 kg above the MTOW. Some 650 m beyond the end of the runway, and 450 m to the right of the extended centreline, the aircraft clipped some trees and crashed. It appeared that the no. 2 engine had been feathered after takeoff; possibly due to fuel contamination."
237,ACC1127,"About 1300 m short of the runway, just after passing the Outer Marker, the left engine went into reverse, causing the left wing to strike the ground. The aircraft, on a delivery flight to Honduras, crashed on a frozen lake."
238,ACC1128,"The aircraft overran the runway on landing and collided with the concrete airport boundary fence, 870 m beyond the runway end.The no. 2 engine operated with forward thrust instead of reverse thrust, because of unsatisfactory interaction among crew members."
239,ACC1129,"The Beechcraft 200 Super King Air had just landed at Cafunfo Airport (CFF), Angola, when the airport was struck by shells fired by UNITA rebels.The pilot decided to turn around immediately and head back to Luanda. Shortly after takeoff an explosion occurred near engine no. 2. The airplane crash-landed in the bush near the airport. The explosion is believed to have been caused by a man portable surface-to-air Stinger missile."
240,ACC1130,"The captain briefly selected maximum reverse thrust during the landing flare. The aircraft landed hard (+4,5g) some 5 metres short of the runway. The Antonov bounced and touched down on the runway. The right hand main gear leg gradually collapsed during rollout."
241,ACC1131,"Whilst applying brakes when approaching a right turn, the Y-12 suddenly veered 90° to the left. The aircraft entered a parking area between Terminal 1 and 2 and collided with a Dornier Do-228 (Pelangi, 9M-PEL). The no. 1 propeller cut into the nose of the parked Pelangi Air commuter aircraft.The brakes failed because the pilot had not selected the hydraulic main system."
242,ACC1132,"Touched down fast 2,304 feet from the approach end of the runway, which was 4,000 feet long. Overran and came to rest after crossing a drainage ditch about 200 feet from the end of runway 18."

248,ACC1138,"A Transmile Cessna Grand Caravan plane carrying about 400 kg of fish and other cargo crashed on takeoff from runway 17 at the Tawau Airport (TWU).The Cessna lifted off the runway after a takeoff run of 2800 feet (860 m). The airplane climbed to a height of 10 feet (3 m) before settling back. It continued in a nose-up attitude and overran the runway by 200 feet (60 m), ran down a 30 feet (9 m) slope and ended up next to some houses.Some six months later (September 15) a Malaysian Airlines Fokker 50 also came down in the shantytown after aborting a runway 17 approach at Tawau.The airport was later closed and the new Tawau airport, situated 31 km away from the city was officially opened in December 2001."
249,ACC1139,"Approaching Reno (RNO), the pilot received an instrument clearance to perform a Localizer DME-1, runway 16R, approach, which the FAA had previously approved for the operator's use. The localizer centreline passed over a 6,161-foot (1885 m) msl mountain, which was depicted on the chart. The pilot was familiar with the area, having transported cargo from Sacramento to Reno for 5 days each week since December, 1994. IMC existed and light snow showers were present. ATC issued the pilot a series of instructions as he was radar vectored toward the final approach fix (FAF), which had a minimum crossing altitude of 6,700 feet (2050 m) msl. The pilot misstated four of the instructions during clearance read backs and was corrected by ATC each time. Contact with the pilot was lost following issuance of his landing clearance. The airplane impacted the mountainside at an elevation of about 6,050 feet (1851 m), while tracking inbound near the centreline of the localizer course, about 2.7 nautical miles before reaching the FAF."

Simultaneously both no. 1 and 2 engines flamed out, resulting in a total electrical power loss. At about 2,500 feet, the pilot was able to control the aircraft again. The crew then ditched the plane."
252,ACC1142,"The Cessna Caravan carried out a local flight out of Luziânia Airport. Four co-pilots and one inspector were carrying out a check flight. While conducting a simulated engine failure, the airplane carried out a short approach. It landed hard short of the runway."
253,ACC1143,"A Boeing 737-4Y0, EI-CEU, was substantially damaged during landing at Denver, Colorado. There were no injuries to the 141 passengers, 4 cabin attendants, and two cockpit crewmembers aboard. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.The airplane was being operated by MarkAir as flight 523, scheduled domestic passenger service from Kansas City, Missouri, to Denver, Colorado. According to the crew, the flight proceeded uneventfully and the approach briefing, radios, instruments, and speed bugs (Vref, 136 KIAS; target speed, 145 KIAS; Vref+15, 151 KIAS, based on a landing weight of 112,000 pounds) were set up for a planned landing on runway 17R. The first officer was flying the airplane.After the airplane had been positioned on the downwind leg, the crew was offered the option of landing on runway 16. This was accepted but when told they could expect a delay to that runway, they requested and were cleared for a visual approach to, and landing on, runway 17R.ATIS (automatic terminal information service) indicated the winds to be from 190 degrees at 18 knots. A surface weather observation in effect at the time indicated the winds were from 180 degrees at 19 knots. The first officer, who was flying the airplane, lined up with runway 17L and when the mistake was realized, they requested and were cleared to land on runway 17L. At 500 feet above ground level, the glide slope aural warning sounded and was cancelled because the radios had been tuned to the navaids serving the parallel runway. At 100 feet AGL, the GPWS (ground proximity warning system) sink rate warning sounded, and the first officer added power. At 50 feet AGL and over the runway threshold, airspeed deteriorated. The first officer applied additional power and the captain added maximum thrust and forward control yoke pressure. A hard landing was made.During its preflight inspection, the relief flight crew noticed damage to the airplane that included a compromised pressure vessel, a crushed tail skid, breaches in the skin with associated stringer damage, and a collapsed right main landing gear strut. The crew flying did not suspect any external damage to the aircraft until arriving at the gate and being told by ground personnel.The data from the airplane's digital flight data recorder (DFDR) showed a vertical acceleration spiking at 3.64 g's when the airplane contacted the runway."
254,ACC1144,"The C-54 airplane was hauling fuel oil to be distributed at Kivalina, AK. Prior to departure from Galena (GAL) the pilot read a NOTAM for Kivalina that the runway had thin, packed snow on it. The pilot reported he flew over the 3,000 ft long by 60 ft wide strip prior to landing, and noted in the center of the runway some gravel was visible through a layer of surrounding snow. He could not see any snow banks or deeper snow in the landing area, and available notices to airmen did not mention any snow banks or snow berms on the runway. The airplane landed near the threshold and on the center line, but, the left main landing gear soon encountered a snow berm and the airplane was pulled to the left. The airplane subsequently impacted other snow berms on the left side of the runway and the nose landing gear collapsed."
255,ACC1145,"The Citation landed short of the runway in the overrun zone, went off the right side of the runway and collided with a tree. The right wing separated, the airplane caught fire, and slid about 300 feet before coming to a complete stop."

The Piper aircraft had just taken off from Sioux Lookout runway 34 and was climbing through 4500 feet on its way to Red Lake when its right wing collided with the Metro's right wing. The accident happened in daylight (13:30 LT) with a visibility >15 miles and a 8000 feet cloud base.
257,ACC1147,Crashed and burned shortly after takeoff. The airplane was departing on a survey flight over the Ural River.It appeared the elevator and rudder locks were still engaged. The aircraft had undergone maintenance prior to the flight and maintenance personnel had failed to remove the locks.
258,ACC1148,"At 08:17 Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 departed Auckland (AKL) as scheduled bound for Palmerston North (PMR).To the north of Palmerston North the pilots briefed themselves for a VOR/DME approach to runway 07 which was the approach they preferred. Subsequently Air Traffic Control specified the VOR/DME approach for runway 25, due to departing traffic, and the pilots re-briefed for that instrument approach. The IMC involved flying in and out of stratiform cloud, but continuous cloud prevailed during most of the approach. The aircraft was flown accurately to join the 14 nm DME arc and thence turned right and intercepted the final approach track of 250° M to the Palmerston North VOR. During the right turn, to intercept the inbound approach track, the aircrafts power levers were retarded to 'flight idle' and shortly afterwards the first officer advised the captain "".... 12 DME looking for 4000 (feet)"". The final approach track was intercepted at approximately 13 DME and 4700 feet, and the first officer advised Ohakea Control ""Ansett 703"" was ""established inbound"". Just prior to 12 miles DME the captain called ""Gear down"". The first officer asked him to repeat what he had said and then responded ""OK selected and on profile, ten - sorry hang on 10 DME were looking for four thousand arent we so - a fraction low"". The captain responded, ""Check, and Flap 15"". This was not acknowledged but the first officer said, ""Actually no, were not, ten DME were..... (The captain whistled at this point) look at that"". The captain had noticed that the right hand main gear had not locked down: ""I dont want that."" and the first officer responded, ""No, thats not good is it, so shes not locked, so Alternate Landing Gear...?"" The captain acknowledged, ""Alternate extension, you want to grab the QRH?"" After the First Officers ""Yes"", the captain continued, ""You want to whip through that one, see if we can get it out of the way before its too late."" The captain then stated, ""Ill keep an eye on the airplane while youre doing that."" The first officer located the appropriate ""Landing Gear Malfunction Alternate Gear Extension"" checklist in Ansett New Zealands Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and began reading it. He started with the first check on the list but the captain told him to skip through some checks. The first officer responded to this instruction and resumed reading and carrying out the necessary actions. It was the operators policy that all items on the QRH checklists be actioned, orproceeded through, as directed by the captain. The first officer started carrying out the checklist. The captain in between advised him to pull the Main Gear Release Handle. Then the GPWSs audio alarm sounded. Almost five seconds later the aircraft collided with terrain. The Dash 8 collided with the upper slope of a low range of hills."

After taking off from Ciudad Obregón at 20:01 hours, the flight reported that it was cancelling its flight plan and returning to the departure airport. After the second take off at 21:18, the flight plan was canceled again as the crew wanted to divert to Tepic. While en route the destination was changed to Guadalajara. However, the controller informed the flight that Guadalajara Airport was closed.The flight crew then opted to divert to Tepic again, maintaining continuous communication with the Mazatlán Center controller. The last communication with the aircraft was that it had the lights of the Tepic Airport in sight. No contact was established with the Tepic Tower. The aircraft crashed a few kilometers from the airport, resulting in fatal injuries to the crew.One of the surviving passengers was a Mexican drug lord, Héctor Luis Palma Salazar, who was arrested after the accident."
263,ACC1153,"East West F-27 VT-EWE was engaged in a training flight at Baroda airport. The aircraft was under the command of an examiner pilot with the trainee pilot on right hand seat. The first touch and go exercise was uneventful. During the second exercise, immediately on touchdown the left main landing gear failed at its shock strut outer cylinder and the inner cylinder with the main wheel assembly attached to it got liberated. The aircraft continued moving forward with the remaining portion of left shock strut contacting the runway followed by the left engine propellers and fuselage bottom and finally came to rest on the runway left side strip. There was no fire and no injury to persons on board the aircraft."
264,ACC1154,The airplane lost control during a visual approach. It struck trees and crashed short of the runway. A wing was torn off and the fuselage caught fire.
265,ACC1155,"The airplane departed Bennington July 3 on a ferry flight to El Paso. A ferry permit, valid for 10 days, had been issued for the planned flight as the aircraft was being flown for delivery to Jet Air Express Inc.The airplane landed in Elmira with a no. 2 engine problem, caused by a broken connecting rod. A new engine was installed and on July 18 the right engine was started and a test flight was made. The following day, a second ferry permit was issued and the airplane departed the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport, about 1040 LT. While cruising at 2,500 feet the no. 2 engine backfired. The propeller couldn't be feathered and the pilot couldn't maintain altitude.At 11:00 LT the right horizontal stabilizer struck a tree about 25 feet above the ground, and the airplane impacted the ground about 100 feet beyond.The last annual maintenance inspection was performed in 1989. Except for three maintenance flights conducted in June, 1995, the airplane had not flown for 5 years."

267,ACC1157,"The Dornier 328-110, N335PH ran off the side of runway 2, during the landing roll, and collided with a runway identification sign at the Portland International Airport, Oregon. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time. The airplane was substantially damaged and there were no injuries. The flight originated from Redding, California, one hour and 17 minutes prior to the accident.The captain reported that the first officer was the flying pilot for the fifth and final flight leg for the day into Portland. A routine visual approach to runway 2 was performed. Touchdown was described as normal and on runway centerline. The captain stated that after the nose wheel touched down, the airplane began a gradual veer to the left. At this time, the captain called for ""his airplane"" and took control of the airplane above 60 knots, by placing his feet on the rudder pedals, right hand on the power levers, and left hand on the tiller. The captain re-aligned the airplane to centerline and called for the condition levers to ""min."" At this time, the airplane began to veer more quickly to the left. The captain attempted to correct the situation and stated that ""my feeling at that point was that I was not in control of the aircraft in terms of being able to keep it on the runway."" The captain stated that he saw the yellow wig-wag sign and increased the left turn to avoid striking the sign. The aircraft tilted to the right and missed the yellow sign, however, before the airplane came to a stop, it struck a runway identification sign. After the engines were secured, the captain told the flight attendant to keep the passengers seated so that he could assess the extent of aircraft damage and assure passenger safety. The first officer remained in the cockpit and made a brief transmission to the control tower to report their situation."
268,ACC1158,"A man claiming to have a gasoline bomb hijacked Phoenix Airways Flight 506 and demanded transit to Cuba. The hijacking took place shortly after the Boeing 727-023 aircraft departed Cape Town en route to Johannesburg. The pilot returned to Cape Town after telling the hijacker that maps and additional fuel were needed to fly the 7,000 miles to Cuba. Shortly after the plane landed, crew members overpowered the hijacker and seized his bag, and he was taken into custody. The hijacker's ""incendiary device"" was a bottle in a paper bag."

While attempting to carry out a go-around, the aircraft crashed into a shantytown. On March 20, 1995 a Cessna Caravan had also crashed into houses following a failed takeoff."
272,ACC1162,"The flight was the second Metro III type-conversion training flight for the co-pilot. Earlier that night, he had completed a 48-minute flight.During the briefing prior to the second flight, the check-and-training pilot indicated that he would give the co-pilot a V 1 cut during the takeoff. The co-pilot questioned the legality of conducting the procedure at night. The check-and-training pilot indicated that it was not illegal because the company operations manual had been amended to permit the procedure. The crew then proceeded to brief the instrument approach which was to be flown following the V 1 cut. There was no detailed discussion concerning the technique for flying a V 1 cut.The co-pilot conducted the takeoff. Four seconds after the aircraft became airborne, the check-and-training pilot retarded the left engine power lever to flight-idle. The landing gear was selected up 11 seconds later. After a further 20 seconds, the aircraft struck the crown of a tree and then the ground about 350 m beyond the upwind end of the runway and 210 m left of the extended centreline. It caught fire and was destroyed. The co-pilot and another trainee on board the aircraft were killed while the check-and-training pilot received serious injuries."
273,ACC1163,"Approaching Campbell River, the pilot requested and received a special visual flight rules (SVFR) clearance to enter the Campbell River control zone.

275,ACC1165,"The Caravan I flight originated in Saltillo, Mexico (SLW), at 18:43. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed throughout the area. According to the operator, the pilot filed an IFR flight plan for a 19:10 departure, requesting 16,000 feet MSL, via direct Monterrey, direct Coahila, with an estimated time en route of one hour and 20 minutes. The pilot estimated in his flight plan a fuel endurance of four hours. While 80 miles (128 km) from the destination airport, the pilot contacted the tower at the Piedras Negras Airport, and was informed that the airport was closed due to inclement weather, which was reported as sky obscured, visibility zero, with fog and drizzle. The airport was served with an NDB. No published approach are available for the airport; however, several local pilots confirmed that a local non-approved instrument procedure had been devised by local pilots. The pilot probably attempted this handwritten chart for an approach to the airport. The flaps were extended in the approach position as the aircraft contacted terrain and crashed."
276,ACC1166,The aircraft overran and stopped 360 m from the end of the paved safety strip. The nose gear was destroyed and the lower part of the fuselage damaged.
277,ACC1167,"During the landing roll the left main gear torque link failed and the wheels separated after a shimmy developed. The shimmy dampening capability of the torque links was degraded by a combination of non-standard clearances in the torque link pins and bushings, and a delay in oleo compression. The oleo did not compress on initial touchdown because of excessive nitrogen pressure, 42 degree flap angle, low descent velocity and low aircraft landing weight."
278,ACC1168,"Nigeria Airways flight WT357 departed Yola (YOL) at 07:00 en route to Lagos (LOS). Intermediate stops were planned at Jos (JOS) and Kaduna (KAD). The Boeing 737 landed at Jos at 07:40 and departed fifty minutes later. The flight to Kaduna was uneventful. Kaduna ATC gave the aircraft an inbound clearance with no delay for a locator approach to runway 05. Though, the initial landing clearance was for runway 05, the captain requested to land on runway 23. He was reminded by the controller that the wind was from 090 magnetic, but he still insisted on using the 23 approach. At 08:42, the aircraft commenced its initial descent at 48 miles on the ILS/DME to 4,500 ft. At 08:49 UTC, it was cleared to 3,500 ft at 10 miles out and was later descended to 500 ft. The aircraft turned left from the track 310 to align with runway 23 and the aircraft was still in the turn when the threshold was sighted just 1.5 miles to the left of the aircraft. The first officer asked the captain ""Can you make it to land from that position?"". The observer in the jump seat also suggested going on the downwind, presumably to re-position the aircraft for landing on runway 05. There was no response at all from the captain and the approach was continued for runway 23. The left turn was very steep and it took the aircraft to the left of the runway centreline and a right correction was applied. The observer shouted ""Watch the wing"" as the wings could have struck the ground on the final approach. By this time, the aircraft crossed the threshold with the flying pilot still struggling to maintain directional control for runway centreline alignment.The aircraft touched down 7820 feet down the runway, leaving just 2020 ft (615.85 m) of runway length. The captain was reported to have used 1.8 and 1.6 EPR on the reversers. When a runway overrun became inevitable, the captain turned the aircraft to the left with the intention to take advantage of the last rapid exit intersection to avoid the runway end lights.At this juncture, the aircraft entered an uncontrollable skid. The right wing hit the ground, thus rupturing the fuel tanks and a huge fire erupted. The aircraft was destroyed by the fire."
279,ACC1169,The Antonov An-2 took off from Makovskoye Airfield in adverse weather conditions. The aircaft was barely able to climb and struck trees at a height of 15 m. The An-2 then crash-landed.

Five of the 76 occupants survived the accident.The Boeing 737, named ""Nyong"", operated on a passenger flight from Cotonou, Benin to Douala, Cameroon. The flight departed at 20:22 UTC and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL330. The en route and descent were uneventful. At 21:32 UTC the flight was cleared for an approach to runway 30. Nine minutes later the flight reported 3,5 NM out at 1100 feet with runway in sight. The tower controller then cleared the flight to land. The aircraft overflew the runway threshold and started to climb. The flight radioed that they were 'having problems' and that they would report back. The tower controller then saw the aircraft in a sharp left hand turn. The airplane descended until it impacted a mangrove swamp."
281,ACC1171,"On landing at Krasnodar at night the crew flared out late and the aircraft landed hard. It bounced five times, suffering g-loads of up to 3.3 g, resulting in the collapse of the nose gear.It was determined that the centre of gravity was too far aft."

In the following crash both the main and the nose landing gear broke off. After approximately 230 m, the airplane came to a stop at the left shoulder between runway and taxiway. The airplane was severely damaged. One passenger suffered a slight back injury, the other occupants were unhurt."
287,ACC1177,"A Beechcraft B100 King Air, N924WS, sustained substantial damage when it contacted a snow berm during landing rollout at Miles City, Montana. The airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, and three passengers on board the aircraft were not injured. The flight had originated at Billings Municipal Airport, MT (BIL) about 06:55. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. There was no fire, and no report of the ELT actuating.The crew landed on the runway in low visibility with the runway lights visible. After touchdown, the left main landing gear contacted a berm or snowbank on the left side of the plowed area, and the pilots were unable to maintain directional control. The aircraft drifted off the left side of the runway and came to rest on a reverse heading. The nose landing gear sheared as the aircraft left the runway. The runway, which was 100 feet in width, had been plowed to about 45.5 feet width along the centerline. No notams had been filed concerning the partially plowed condition of the runway."
288,ACC1178," The airplane touched down in a snow field 1,000 feet beyond the runway threshold and 25 feet right of runway centerline.

290,ACC1180,"The Citation operated on a flight from Recife to Fazenda Matary with an intermediate stop at Imperatriz. On the last leg the instructor occupied the left seat and a training pilot occupied the right seat. While approaching Fazenda Matary, the instructor indicated that they would carry out a touch-and-go in order to observe the condition of the runway. Flaps were set at 15 degrees during the approach. The airspeed on finals was 125 kts, which is above the normal speed of 116 kts. After touchdown the instructor decided to make a full stop instead of a taking off again, but did not inform the training pilot. The training pilot observed the speed and noted that it fell below takeoff speed. With the end of the runway getting closer, he intervened and advanced the throttles for takeoff. The instructor thought the airplane still could be stopped on the runway. He took over control and retarded the throttles. The Citation overran the runway and caught fire."
291,ACC1181,"The Islander departed Fukuoka at 12:52 on a flight to Nagasaki. En route the airplane encountered snowy weather. The pilot suddenly saw a forested mountain ridge ahead. He tried to avoid a collision, but the airplane descended into the trees on the Takami Peak."
292,ACC1182,"During a training flight where a touch-and-go landing was being practised, the nose gear started to collapse during the landing roll. The nose of the aircraft dropped and both propellers hit the runway. The instructor initiated a go-around and the aircraft became airborne again. The right engine was subsequently shut down due to vibration. The aircraft returned to home base where the landing was made without further incident."

296,ACC1186,The Islander was being ferried to the United States. It departed Reykjavík weighing 297 kg in excess of the mtow. Shortly after takeoff the pilot radioed that she had dropped her portable GPS on the floor and could not locate it. She decided to divert to Keflavik International Airport. During descent the no. 2 engine failed. The pilot did not feather the prop nor did she try to restart the engine. The airplane descended until it crash-landed in rough terrain some 5 nm (9 km) short of the airport. Investigation revealed that the mixture control for the no. 2 engine was pulled back. This may have occurred inadvertently by the pilot's sleeve when searching for the GPS device.
297,ACC1187,"The aircraft took off from runway 07 at 20:35 for the second training flight out of Belfast that night. After some 3-engined approaches to runway 17, the Viscount landed and immediately took off again.The crew were later cleared to commence a VOR/DME approach to runway 07 for a final landing. The 'Initial Approach' checks were completed 'down to the line'. However, although the first officer at one stage commented that it was a bit early to complete the rest of the 'Initial Approach' checks, there was no evidence that these or the 'Finals' checks were subsequently requested or actioned. The landing gear would normally be selected down during the 'Initial Approach, below the line' checks and confirmed during the 'Finals' checks. As the throttles were retarded in the flare, the gear warning horn was heard on the CVR, followed within 2 seconds by sounds of the propellers contacting the runway surface. After coming to a stop on the runway, the crew secured and evacuated the aircraft."
298,ACC1188,"An Egyptian man and his teen-aged son and nephew hijacked Egypt Air flight 104 a few minutes after takeoff from Luxor. The flight had just stopped there en route from Jeddah to Cairo. The hijackers claimed to possess explosives and demanded to meet with world leaders. The pilot diverted the plane to Libya and landed at Derna-Martuba.

299,ACC1189,"A Cessna 500 Citation, N727TK, experienced an uncontained engine failure during the take off ground roll at the Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah, USA. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The airplane was substantially damaged, and the private and commercial pilots, and their five passengers were not injured. The flight was destined for Visalia, California.The engine start and all pre-take off checks were completed with no abnormalities noted. The airplane was taxied to runway 35 and held for approximately ten minutes before the tower controller cleared the flight for take off. After advancing the thrust levers through 80-81%, a loud ""boom"" was heard and the airplane began to shake.  The thrust lever for the right engine was brought back to idle power and the pilot continued to taxi back to the apron. It was noted that debris from the engine had punctured the side of the pressure vessel and damaged the wing."
300,ACC1190,"The aircraft undershot during the final stage of the approach to runway 06 at Nain Airport, Newfoundland, Canada, impacting the ground some 300 feet short of the threshold. The pilot later reported that she was trying to touchdown as close to the threshold as possible because the runway is only 2,000 feet long and was known to be icy.The sky was overcast and the approach path was over an area of flat, snow covered, featureless terrain. Another pilot who landed about 30 minutes after the accident reported 'serious whiteout conditions."

302,ACC1192,"A United States Air Force Boeing T-43A (USAF designation for the Boeing 737-200) was destroyed after impacting a hillside during an NDB approach to Dubrovnik Airport, Croatia. All 35 on board were killed.The aircraft was engaged in a mission to fly United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and a delegation of industry executives around the region for visits. The party was to be flown from Zagreb to Tuzla and Dubrovnik before returning to Zagreb.Operating with a call sign of IFO21, the accident aircraft departed Zagreb at 06:24 hours. The crew landed at Tuzla at 07:15 after an uneventful flight. The passengers deplaned, and the aircraft was then repositioned to Split because of insufficient ramp space at Tuzla to park the aircraft for the duration of the visit.At 12:47, the aircraft landed at Tuzla, where the passengers reboarded. The accident flight departed Tuzla for Dubrovnik at 13:55. After crossing Split at 14:34 the flight was cleared to descend from FL210 to FL140. Further descent clearance was given to FL100. After the aircraft reached FL100 at 14:45, south of Split VOR, Zagreb Center transferred control to Dubrovnik Approach/Tower.The controller cleared IFO21 direct to the Kolocep (KLP) NDB. After opposite-direction traffic had been cleared, IFO21 was cleared to descend to 5000 feet. At 14:52, the crew told Dubrovnik Approach/Tower that they were 16 NM from the airport. They were cleared to descend to 4,000 feet and told to report crossing the KLP beacon.At 14:53, the aircraft crossed KLP, which was the Final Approach Fix (FAF), at 4100 feet and began the approach without approach clearance from Dubrovnik Tower. At that point the aircraft was slightly high and fast and not completely configured for the approach, as it should have been. At 14:54, the copilot of IFO21 called  Dubrovnik Approach/Tower and said, ""Were inside the locator, inbound."" IFO21 was then cleared for the NDB approach to runway 12. The aircraft tracked a course of 110 degrees after crossing KLP, instead of tracking the published course of 119 degrees. The aircraft maintained this track from KLP to the point of impact. The accident aircraft descended to 2200 feet which was consistent with the published minimum descent altitude of 2150 feet.At 14:57, the aircraft impacted a rocky  mountainside approximately 1.7 NM to the left (northeast) of the extended runway centerline and 1.8 NM north of the approach end of runway 12 at Dubrovnik Airport."

305,ACC1195,"During a night time takeoff from Comodoro Rivadavia Airport, CB (CRD) the airplane's nose gear collided with a dog that suddenly crossed the runway. Takeoff was continued, but the crew received a 'low hydraulic pressure' warning. The airplane circled for 100 minutes to burn fuel before a landing back at Comodoro Rivadavia was accomplished."
306,ACC1196,"A Mitsubishi MU-2B-30 (VH-WMW) was to be flown on a cargo flight from Bankstown to Wagga Wagga, Australia. At the same time another aircraft, Metro II VH-UUK was also to be flown on a cargo flight from Bankstown to Cootamundra, Australia. The MU-2 taxied at 06:30 for runway 29C, followed some three minutes later by the Metro II. The MU-2 proceeded along taxiway X, then across the 29 engine runup area towards taxiway S1, which also required crossing taxiway K.The Metro II proceeded along taxiway K, towards taxiway S1. As he taxied through the runup area the MU-2 pilot was unaware of the presence of the Metro II on taxiway K. The Metro II pilot had seen the MU-2 to his left, taxiing through the runup area, and assumed that the pilot of that aircraft would give way to him. He reported that his attention was mainly directed ahead and to his right, as he monitored departing aircraft.As the MU-2 was turning left out of the runup area to cross taxiway K, the pilot felt a lurch to the left as his aircraft was struck from the rear right. The wing of the Metro II had passed under the right wing tip fuel tank and then into the propeller of the right engine, resulting in substantial damage to both aircraft. The pilot of the Metro II had been unaware of the close proximity of the MU-2 until the impact pulled the nose of his aircraft to the left, and he saw the other aircraft. Both pilots conducted emergency shut-downs and escaped from their aircraft without injury.Pilots of adjacent aircraft witnessed the accident and reported that it was a clear morning with no obstructions to visibility. Immediately prior to impact, the witnesses observed the aircraft to be converging at an angle of approximately 50 degrees and thought it was going to be close. When the impact was seen as inevitable, they were unable to give a warning call as the ground radio frequency was congested."
307,ACC1197,"On 24 April 1996 at 04:18 hours the aircraft took off from Dar es salaam International Airport on a charter flight to Tabora via Morogoro. The pilot was the only occupant. The estimated time of arrival at Morogoro was 04:49 hours. 5H-TZD maintained communications with the Dar es Salaam Tower and was cleared to flight Level 60 to the TMA boundary. At 04:40 hours 5H-TZD advised that he was estimating TMA at 04:41 hours at FL60. The estimate for Morogoro was revised to 04:51 hours and was to call on ""top of descent"". No further transmission was heard from the aircraft.The wreckage of the aircraft was discovered top of Palapala Mountains (Uluguru Mountain Range) on 5 May 1996 after extensive search. The aircraft was completely destroyed by impact and the subsequent fire.It is concluded that the accident was caused by the aircraft colliding with high ground approximately 5 N.M. short of the runway. The decision of the pilot to initiate descent in weather conditions which allowed no visual contact with the high terrain was the major contributory factor."
308,ACC1198,"A Rockwell Sabreliner 80, N773W, was substantially damaged when the pilot aborted takeoff at Albuquerque, New Mexico. There were no injuries to the airline transport rated captain and first officer and three passengers.According to the operator, takeoff was initiated on runway 21 (10,000 ft x 150 ft., concrete). Approximately 90 to 100 knots, the aircraft moved to the left of the runway centerline, requiring right aileron correction. When the airplane had achieved approximately 120 knots and was about 5,000 feet down the runway, there was a loud noise followed by a severe vibration, and the airplane pulled hard to the right. The captain initiated aborted takeoff procedures by applying brakes and reverse thrust. The aircraft tracked across and departed the left side of the runway. The nose landing gear collapsed and the aircraft came to a halt 300 feet beyond the departure end of the runway.Federal Aviation Administration inspectors reported there was evidence that the left main tires blew out at the 3,800-foot mark. At the 5,000-foot mark, the airplane went onto the right shoulder of the runway. At the 9,800-foot mark, the airplane departed the left side of the runway. In addition to the blown left tires, the right tires were found flattened. Three runway lights were also damaged."
309,ACC1199,"A Swearingen Metro III, operated by PenAir, dragged a wing and landed hard while attempting to land on runway 11 at the St. George Airport, Alaska. The hard landing collapsed the right main landing gear and nose landing gear. The flight departed St. Paul, Alaska, and the destination was St. George. A visual flight rules flight plan was in effect. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the St. George Airport. The two pilots and the eleven passengers were not injured. The airplane received substantial damage."
310,ACC1200,"The pilot-in-command, who was also the owner of Buffalo Narrows Airways, had just purchased the aircraft from Taquan Air in Ketchikan. He intended to ferry the Otter to their base of operations in Buffalo Narrows. The aircraft flew into a mountain at 7000 feet in marginal weather conditions."
311,ACC1201,The Islander lost airspeed as the pilot flew into a valley over rising terrain. He attempted to make a 180 degree turn but the wing touched some trees and the airplane crashed into the trees.
312,ACC1202,"The DC-9 had strayed some 300 miles off course on a flight from Orlando to Cancún. Because the aircraft was low on fuel, the crew chose to divert to Tampico. But when the aircraft was 65 miles out of Tampico, both engines flamed out. When on finals for runway 31, the gear was lowered. The sudden drag caused higher rate of descent and resulted in the aircraft touching down 300 m short of the runway. The nosegear and right main gear collapsed when the aircraft struck concrete plinths of the approach lights."
313,ACC1203,"The Islander had operated on an ambulance flight to Inverness and was ferried back to its base at Tingwall Airport. The pilot manoeuvred the airplane for an approach to runway 02. While turning to finals the aircraft was blown through the centerline, forcing the pilot to abandon the approach. He climbed to 550 feet and positioned the airplane for another approach. For this second attempt the pilot extended the downwind leg by approximately 800 metres before turning towards the airfield. A rapid turn to finals with a steep bank angle was performed during which the aircraft descended. In a right wing low attitude of some 70°and a nose low attitude of approximately 20° the aircraft collided with grass covered gently rising terrain, 1,5 km South of the runway. Its groundspeedat this time was estimated at 125 kt."
314,ACC1204,"The pilot had levelled the aircraft and configured it for cruise flight at approximately 2,500 feet above sea level when the pilot heard a popping sound and noted a slight loss of engine power, and wisps of whitish-grey smoke entered the cabin. The aircraft instruments indicated normal engine operation, and the fire warning system did not activate. The pilot suspected that the engine had suffered a cylinder failure and turned to return to Cochenour. A passenger seated in the right front crew seat reported flames near the floor at the front, right corner of the cockpit. The pilot radioed the Thunder Bay Flight Service Station to advise of the emergency, had the passenger vacate the crew seat, and attempted to suppress the fire with a hand-held extinguisher. Thick, black smoke billowed into the cabin, restricting visibility and causing respiratory distress for all of the occupants. The pilot opened the left crew door in order to see ahead and landed the aircraft, still on fire, on McNeely Bay, the first available landing site. The aircraft landed hard but remained upright on the floats. The occupants left by the main door, with their life jackets, and were picked up almost immediately by nearby boats. The aircraft was consumed by fire within minutes after landing."
315,ACC1205,"The Skyvan was hired for Para dropping purposes at Hoogeveen. In order to carry the maximum number of paras, a calculation was made prior to every flight in order to establish the acceptable minimum amount of fuel for the flight. During the 6th flight that day both engines quit while climbing. All paras were ordered to jump immediately. Thinking they had an engine failure, the crew tried to light one engine, but didn't succeed. A forced landing was carried out in a potato-field 500 m short of Hoogeveen Airport."
316,ACC1206,"During the departure climb from runway 18, the airplane experienced a loss of engine power. Emergency procedures were executed and a forced landing was initiated to a field. While on the approach the pilot observed a ditch running across the proposed landing pathway and turned the airplane to the right to parallel the ditch. During the landing roll, the pilot attempted to avoid a building by intentionally ground looping the airplane. During this avoidance maneuver, the left wing struck the building."
317,ACC1207,"The crew turned onto final too early and deviated 3 km to the right of the intended track. Despite alert from the GPWS, the crew kept flying in fog below the Minimum Descent Altitude. The aircraft crashed into a 100 m high mountain. Both pilots were killed; the other occupants survived with various injuries."
318,ACC1208,"An Embraer EMB-120, N168CA, experienced a landing gear failure on arrival at the Orlando International Airport, Florida, USA. The flightcrew completed emergency procedures with negative results, and an emergency landing was made. 	The pilot-in-command stated on descent into the Orlando area the hydraulic master caution warning light illuminated, followed by the low level advisory light on the green hydraulic system. He instructed the first officer to review the loss of hydraulic pressure procedure in the quick reference handbook. The hydraulic master caution warning light illuminated again, followed by the low pressure advisory light on the green hydraulic system. The fluid level was pointing to the yellow, the hydraulic pressure was decreasing, and the light for the green system was flashing on and off. The flightcrew concluded that the green hydraulic system was empty and the green electric hydraulic pump was turned off. They discussed what systems would be lost in the event of a total failure of the green hydraulic system, and decided to lower the flaps and landing gear. The flaps were extended to 15 degrees; however the landing gear would not extend. They informed ATC of situation, and were placed in a box pattern east of Orlando International Airport. They performed the abnormal emergency landing gear instructions in the checklist and contacted the Comair maintenance facility for further instructions. Repeated attempts to lower the landing gear were unsuccessful, and a gear up landing was performed."
319,ACC1209,"While performing an IFR training flight, the aircraft was cleared to descend from 3000 ft to 1000 ft. It did not report at 1000 ft. While flying below the minimum safe altitude, the aircraft struck trees located on a 626 m hill which was surrounded by thick fog."
320,ACC1210,The Twin Otter struck a mountain in clouds and rain at an altitude of 9200 feet.
321,ACC1211,"The DC-6 cargo plane departed Emmonak at 14:10 for a flight to Aniak. At 14:55 the no. 3 engine caught fire and the fire handles were pulled. The captain then ordered the propeller the be feathered. At 14:57 the first officer confirms that number 3 actually feathered, but said they were still indicating a fire. The captain then decided to carry out an emergency landing at Holy Cross. While the captain was preparing the airplane for landing the first officer stated that the fire is starting to go out. METO power was applied and the captain remarked that if the fire is out he would rather not land at Holy Cross. The fire warning bell sounded again at 14:59 and smoke began entering the cockpit. An approach was made to Russian Mission and the aircraft passed over the airport at 300-400 feet and was later seen turning to finals when the right wing folded upward. The aircraft rolled to the right and nosed down into the ground, short of runway 35."
322,ACC1212,Insufficient deceleration after landing on runway 33. The aircraft was steered off the side of the runway and was damaged beyond repair when it struck the raised lip of a small ramp which caused the gear to collapse.
323,ACC1213,"The Twin Otter was flying at low altitude (contrary to regulations); the right wing struck a hill, causing the aircraft to lose control and crash."
324,ACC1214,"The Twin Otter was carrying six barrels of Jet B fuel for a helicopter company to Markham Bay, an off-strip landing site. and touched down just after the threshold. The aircraft became airborne 18 m further on and bounced two times before touching down for the last time. The brakes were applied, but power was increased later in an attempt to takeoff again. The aircraft became airborne when the ground fell away beyond the runway and flew for 1000 feet before striking a rock with the main gear. The gear was sheared off and the Twin Otter stalled and crashed onto a rocky beach."
325,ACC1215,"The DC-4 aircraft, named 'Yukon Trader' was on a VFR flight from a remote mining strip at Bronson Creek, Canada to Wrangell, USA with a crew of three and about 16,600 pounds of cargo on board. At an altitude of 1,500 feet after takeoff the crew heard a whining noise. They switched inverters, but the problem persisted. Electrical instrument indications in the cockpit then became erratic, and the number 2 engine began to misfire; its fire warning light in the cockpit illuminated briefly. The crew carried out the engine fire drill; however, the fire did not extinguish. The captain commenced a right-hand turn to return to the Bronson Creek airstrip, and announced to the crew that the number 2 engine had separated from the wing. The captain applied maximum power to the three remaining engines; however, the aircraft began to lose altitude. Both pilots held the rudder and aileron controls at full right deflection in an attempt to prevent the aircraft from yawing or rolling to the left. The aircraft was shaking violently at that time, and the crew members were unable to read any of the engine or flight instruments. At about 50 feet above ground level, just short of the Iskut River, the pilots closed the throttles. The aircraft descended rapidly, and the burning left wing struck a tree just as the fuselage contacted the surface of the river. The three occupants escaped the burning aircraft, and the first officer and load master swam to safety. The captain is missing and is presumed to have drowned."
326,ACC1216,"The aircraft was scheduled to complete a flight test following major repairs to the left wing and fuselage. These were carried out in Broome to repair damage resulting from a birdstrike which occurred in May 1996. The crew for the flight comprised two experienced pilots, one of whom was a qualified test pilot, and a flight test engineer. There were no passengers. When the landing gear was selected up, after takeoff, the nose landing gear door unsafe and landing gear handle lights remained on. The gear was selected down and safe indications were obtained. The gear was selected up a second time and it retracted normally. The test flight was continued, with sequences being completed up to the landing gear tests. Landing gear down selection resulted in a safe indication on the main gear (two green lights) and unsafe indications on the nose gear (a red gear light, no amber door light and a light in the gear handle). Actions were completed in accordance with the abnormal and emergency checklist however, the nose gear continued to indicate unsafe.An inspection by ground engineers, during a fly-past, determined that the nose gear was still retracted but the gear doors were partially open. Positive-gravity manoeuvres and a touch-and-go landing failed to shake the nose gear free. The crew decided to land at Broome once all other traffic was clear and emergency services were in place. Advice from the manufacturer's representative in Broome indicated that the propellers would remain clear of the runway during the landing. A landing was completed with the aircraft sliding to a stop on its main wheels and nose, 460 m after touchdown.It is probable that motivation, pressure and fatigue were the main factors in the decision not to complete the maintenance control manual requirements prior to manufacturing the replacement cover plate. It is likely that the maintenance engineers allowed their desire to get the job done to overcome any caution developed through experience. Limited time availability meant that ordering a replacement part, or ensuring the completion of the required design and approval process, would prevent them meeting the deadline. Fatigue may have reduced the maintenance engineer's analytical ability and possibly contributed to the flawed decision.The lack of a project manager to supervise and audit the complete engineering process meant there was no safety net to prevent incorrect decisions or practices, emanating from the workface, having a detrimental affect on safety. The lack of a project manager and the limited presence of the technical manager also meant there was no one of authority that the maintenance engineers could readily discuss the problem with before they made their final decision.The fact that the cover plate was not a structural component and was only a protective cover probably misled the maintenance engineers into believing that the manufacture of a similar, but not exact, replacement part would not significantly affect safety.The ultimate safety net, landing gear retraction tests, failed when the cover plate was not fitted prior to the tests. The plate was not fitted because it was not seen as a significant part of the landing gear system and time pressure probably led maintenance personnel to believe that the tests could not wait until assembly was complete."

The right main landing gear touched down approximately 345 feet before reaching the threshold of runway 27. The wheels of the right landing gear travelled about 20 feet and struck a snow ridge which had been created as snow removal equipment turned in the under run area. The ridge was about 2 feet high and consisted of frozen snow. The right landing gear drag links failed and the right gear moved rearward pivoting at the trunnion. The left gear wheels touched down about 326 feet ahead of the runway threshold. The aircraft slid off the right side of the runway and sustained substantial damage. The right main landing gear punctured the fuel tank in the right wing when the gear collapsed.

348,ACC1238,"Pantanal flight 126 departed Campo Grande (CGR) for a 2 hours and 15 min. flight to Vilhena (BVH). The captain was an instructor, the copilot was receiving line training. The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF). While approaching Vilhena, the weather was reported below minima. Instead of diverting to the alternate airport, the captain decided they should execute an Echo 1 arrival procedure, which was an NDB approach to runway 03. Because actual weather at Vilhena had differed from reported weather conditions in the past, they would descend to MDA. If the runway was not in sight at that point, the approach would be aborted. The copilot inserted an MDA of 2500 feet in the Altitude Alert System. This was an error since the MDA was actually 2560 feet. Both pilot did not notice the error. The instructor told the copilot to monitor the artificial horizon during the final stages of the approach. The copilot focused on the artificial horizon and did not monitor the altimeter. The captain tried to obtain visual contact with the ground, but the city lights were off due to lack of electric energy. He did not call out the altitudes and the airplane did not level off at 2500 feet. The copilot probably shut off or silenced the Altitude Alert System and the airplane continued to descend below MDA. The airplane collided with various trees located to the right and one kilometre short of runway 03. It collided with the ground and skidded to a stop. A fire erupted in the no. 1 engine, spreading to the rest of the airplane. All occupants managed to escape."
349,ACC1239,"The aircraft was engaged on a tour of European States carrying the President of Zimbabwe and his staff. It had departed Zimbabwe on 2 March 1997 and arrived in Dublin, Ireland on 7 March 1997. It departed from Dublin at 21.15 hrs on 10 March 1997 and arrived at Shannon to refuel, prior to departure direct to Harare, Zimbabwe.The aircraft took off from runway 24 at Shannon Airport at 22:48 hrs. Because of the high weight the captain used maximum Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) settings for this takeoff. Immediately after takeoff, at approximately 500 ft, the captain was alerted to a fire in the No. 3 engine by audio and visual alarms. He continued to 1,000 ft, in order to gain safe altitude, whereupon he closed down No. 3 engine and initiated fire extinguishing drill. He discharged one fire-extinguishing bottle into the engine, waited 30 seconds and then discharged the second bottle. He was informed by personnel in the cabin that flames had been seen under No. 3 engine, but that they had then disappeared. The fire warning light remained illuminated, but the captain was aware that fire damage to the detection harness could cause the warning light to remain on. He then commenced a circuit and proceeded to dump fuel as the aircraft had taken off at almost maximum gross weight and full fuel. While there were no visual indicators of continued fire in No. 3 engine, the fire warning light was still on, and he decided to dump fuel only from the opposite, left, side of the aircraft. He lowered the left fuel dump chute and proceeded to dump fuel. During this time the captain assessed his landing options. The weather at Shannon Airport was deteriorating and there was a strong possibility that the airport would close shortly. Because of this, he did not have the option of loitering in the Shannon area to burn off fuel. Furthermore, because the B707 has only tank-to-engine cross-transfer, it was not possible to dump right wing fuel from the left wing dump chute. The captain was concerned that if he dumped 30 tons of fuel from the left dump chute to bring the aircraft weight below the maximum landing weight, the aircraft would then be suffering a lateral imbalance of nearly 30 tons, with the added complication that only one engine was operative on the heavy (right) side. The captain therefore decided to terminate the dumping after disposing of 10 tons of fuel and to land immediately thereafter at Shannon Airport. As he lined up for landing, at about 2,700 ft, he attempted to raise the left dump chute, which failed to retract. The captain desired to raise the dump chute because deployment of the dump chute in the extended position would interfere with the selection of full flap. As the aircraft was still 30 tonnes above maximum landing weight of 112 tonnes, the captain considered that he required full landing flap for landing in this condition. Because selection of full flap would result in damage to the extended dump chute, he elected to perform an overshoot in order to sort out the dump chute problem. After the over-shoot, a further attempt was made to retract the dump chute, and this was successful. During this phase of the flight, a fault also developed in the aircraft's Instrument Landing System (ILS) display.The captain then commenced a second approach. When he selected undercarriage down, the green lights that indicate that the main wheels were lowered and locked down illuminated, but the green indicator for the nose wheel did not illuminate. He again elected to overshoot. Minimum altitude on this approach was 1,700 ft. He selected undercarriage up. The main undercarriage retracted but the nose did not.Noise under the cockpit indicated that the nose undercarriage doors were still open. The captain then received ATC clearance to a holding area West of Shannon to consider the situation. He considered diverting to Gatwick, where Air Zimbabwe has a maintenance base, but Gatwick was subject to deteriorating weather and other airports such as Heathrow, Dublin and Cork were already closed due to poor visibility.Furthermore, there was continued concern regarding a possible deterioration of the weather at Shannon. When the aircraft was in the holding area, the undercarriage selection lever was moved, as normal, to the OFF position, having been previously on the UP position when the overshoot was initiated. The co-pilot then noticed that the nose green light had illuminated, indication that the nose wheel was now in the DOWN position. The flight engineer performed a visual inspection and confirmed that the nose undercarriage was down but not locked. When the undercarriage DOWN was then selected, the main wheel green lights also illuminated, and a visual inspection by the flight engineer confirmed that the nose undercarriage was now down and locked.The captain then decided to return to Shannon. He set up a long 25-mile approach, and touched down smoothly, without any further problem. The captain turned off the runway, and stopped while the attendant crash rescue service inspected the No. 3 engine for fire. Upon receiving a ""no fire"" report from the on-scene crash crews, the captain decided against emergency evacuation of the aircraft. The aircraft then taxied to the terminal and the passengers disembarked normally."

Three hours later, the pilot determined that he was fuel critical due to unforecast headwinds. He declared a low fuel emergency and changed his intended destination to Hilo, HI. He also requested Coast Guard assistance at that time. Approximately 4 hours later, the pilot elected to ditch under power rather than remain airborne until fuel depletion."

358,ACC1248,"Weather at the time of departure from Emerald was reported to be 6 to 7 OKTAS of low cloud with patches of rain in the area. Light rain was falling at the time the aircraft taxied. The wind was light with a slight crosswind from the right. Visibility was in excess of 10 KM. The runway was damp and there were several patches of water on the runway.The pilot reported that the take-off proceeded normally until approximately 50 knots when he disengaged the nose-wheel steering. At this point, the aircraft started to diverge to the right of the centreline. In an attempt to return the aircraft to the centreline the pilot used rudder but this was ineffective. The pilot then rejected the take-off by moving the power levers to idle but the aircraft continued to diverge to the right and departed the sealed surface of the runway.The pilot used reverse thrust in an attempt to slow the aircraft but this appeared ineffective and the aircraft continued to turn to the right and slide on the wet grass surface. The aircraft by this time was heading for a small levee bank beside a drainage ditch. The pilot assessed that the aircraft would probably climb over the levee bank, so he elected to introduce power on the left engine in an attempt to turn the aircraft before the levee bank. However, this was only partially successful and the aircraft came to rest adjacent to the levee bank facing approximately 180 degrees from the take-off heading. The left propeller contacted the bank as the aircraft stopped. The aircraft had travelled 121 M after leaving the runway. The distance at which the aircraft left the centreline of the runway could not be accurately determined due to the runway surface. The nose-wheel track was approximately 1metre to the left of the right hand wheel track and continued at this distance until approximately 5 metres from the end of the tracks, at which point it crossed over the top of the right wheel track.The aircraft suffered damage to the left propeller and engine. Examination of the engine when removed from the aircraft confirmed that it had suffered considerable internal damage consistent with a propeller strike at high power."

360,ACC1250,"Skywest Flight 724, an Embraer EMB-120, N198SW, experienced a total loss of engine power to the right engine and associated engine fire, followed by a total loss of all airplane hydraulic systems, after takeoff from San Diego International-Lindbergh Field, California. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The 2 pilots, 1 flight attendant, and 14 passengers were not injured. According to the pilots, about 2,000 feet mean sea level (msl) during the initial climb, a bang sound was heard; the airplane yawed right, and the right propeller auto feathered. Flames were observed by passengers and the cabin attendant emanating from the right engine. The crew performed the engine shutdown and fire check lists, and turned off the fuel within 1 minute of the mishap. The cockpit crew extinguished the fire using both of the airplane's fire bottles. The cockpit crew then observed that hydraulic and rudder lights on the master alert panel were illuminated, along with the associated hydraulic lights on the overhead panel, which indicated loss of both hydraulic systems.The crew diverted to Naval Air Station (NAS) Miramar, extended the landing gear manually, and accomplished a landing without flaps. The captain indicated that he landed within the first 2,000 feet of runway 24R. He was unable to use single engine reverse thrust to decelerate because of the loss of nose wheel steering. Additionally, the captain attempted to use the airplane's primary and emergency brakes; however, hydraulic pressure was also lost to these systems. The airplane overran the departure end of the runway and came to rest in the adjacent field."
361,ACC1251,The crew carried out a forced landing in a field when the aircraft ran out of fuel. It broke in two. The baggage pod was destroyed.Significant but non-fatal injuries to crew and passengers.
362,ACC1252,"The aircraft crashed in flames, killing all on board."
363,ACC1253,"During the landing roll with the speedbrakes deployed, the anti-skid activated and the brakes were applied but the airplane was not decelerating. A go-around was initiated but the plane failed to clear a grove of trees, collided and came to rest upright."

365,ACC1255,"The Carvair took off from Venetie for a VFR positioning flight to Fairbanks. The aircraft was climbing when the number two engine on the left wing began to run rough. Soon thereafter, a fire warning light for the same engine illuminated in the cockpit. Fire was visually confirmed, the engine was shut down, and both banks of fire bottles were discharged. The fire continued to burn, and the number two engine fell off the wing. The captain was forced to carry out an emergency landing on a sand and gravel bar in the Chandalar River."
366,ACC1256,"A de Havilland DHC-6-300, N776BF, collapsed the nose gear on landing at the Elko Municipal Airport, Nevada. The aircraft was substantially damaged. Touchdown at Elko was slightly right of centerline and when the nose gear touched down, the aircraft started to veer to the left. Adding brakes on the right side had no result.The airplane veered off the runway to the left and the nose gear collapsed."
367,ACC1257,"The Learjet crew consisted of an instructor and a trainee pilot. For the short flight from Phuket to Ranong the crew were supposed to carry out the approach briefing before takeoff. They failed to do so, which left them little time en route to carry out the procedure and cross-checking the distance and altitude during the flight. The instructor misinterpreted the Ranong DME distance and caused the trainee pilot to descend below minimum sector altitude in unfavourable weather conditions. The aircraft consequently flew into high terrain."
368,ACC1258,"The airplane was on short final to land on runway 34 when it encountered heavy rain, which reduced forward visibility. The pilot continued the landing, and during the landing roll, the airplane drifted right and the right wing contacted brush and trees. The airplane departed the right side of the 1,700-foot-long x 50-foot-wide runway."
369,ACC1259,"The aircraft took off from Resende at 09:50 for a flight to Guaratingueta, but failed to arrive at the destination. The aircraft had struck a 1500 m high mountain (Alto do Cerco). The plane had dropped 12 parachutists after takeoff from Resende."
370,ACC1260,"The aircraft touched down 1175 feet down runway 22R at 149 knots with a 500f/min descent rate and 1,67g acceleration. The flight bounced, yawed and rolled right, and touched down again 2275 feet from the threshold, at 1,7g (lateral acceleration 0,4g to the right) and dragging the no. 3 engine 238 feet further on. The right roll, pinning the no. 3 engine to the ground, possibly continued until the right wing's spars broke. The MD-11 skidded off the right side of the runway and ended up on its back 4800 feet from the threshold and just short of Terminal B.The aircraft, N611FE, had suffered a similar incident (bounced on landing) in Anchorage, November 4, 1994."
371,ACC1261,The takeoff from runway 30 was abandoned following a tire burst at 110 knots. The aircraft skidded off the runway into shrubs and was engulfed in smoke when coming to rest 130 m past the runway. Both engines and the left main gear were torn off in the crash sequence.
372,ACC1262,"The pilot of N1202S, was executing a non-standard right traffic pattern approach to landing at Fajardo, while the pilot of another BN-2 Islander, N26JA, was executing a standard left traffic pattern approach to landing.

375,ACC1265,"A McDonnell-Douglas MD-82, operating as Alaska Airlines flight 255 from Los Angeles, California, to Seattle, Washington, sustained substantial damage when its nose landing gear collapsed during landing roll-out on runway 16L at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Seventeen of the 111 passengers incurred minor injuries during the emergency evacuation commanded by the captain after the airplane slid to a stop. There was no fire.The flight was uneventful until the landing gear was extended and the nose landing gear warning light indicated an unsafe landing gear indication. At that time, the crew initiated a go-around (retracting the landing gear), climbed to a safe altitude in safe airspace, and then completed appropriate checklists in an attempt to obtain a safe gear-down indication with the landing gear extended. After completing appropriate checklists, the mechanical nose landing gear position indicator indicated that the nose landing gear was extended in a down and locked position, while the light continued to indicate an unsafe condition. The crew elected to land, and requested emergency equipment standing by. The captain stated that he landed the airplane smoothly; at about 60 knots indicated airspeed, the nose settled onto the runway and the airplane slid to a stop. The airplane slid about 1300 feet and drifted slightly to the right of centerline. He commanded an evacuation."
376,ACC1266,"The aircraft started its takeoff roll from Nejran's runway 06/24. Accelerating through 95 kts the crew noted that the engine thrust of the no.2 engine suddenly increased. At 120 kts the EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) warning light illuminated. The captain attempted reduce engine thrust of the no. 2 engine but was not able to do so. Takeoff was aborted, the speed brakes were deployed and brakes applied. The thrust reversers did not deploy and the insufficient runway length remained. The 737 aircraft overran the runway into the sand. Both main gear legs collapsed during a ground-loop and the no. 2 engine separated. A fuel spill caused a fire. The fuselage was seen in use as a snack bar at the King Khalid Air Base, Saudi Arabia in 2003."
377,ACC1267,"The Boeing 727-51C was involved in a ground collision with an airport shuttle bus while taxiing for takeoff at Denver International Airport. The captain sustained serious injuries; the first officer received minor injuries, and the flight engineer was not injured. The shuttle bus driver received minor injuries. Two passengers aboard the bus were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR flight plan had been filed for the scheduled domestic cargo flight. Preliminary information indicates the shuttle bus was en route from the employees' south parking lot to concourse C. The bus was traveling north on a road that crosses the south cargo ramp. According to the first officer, N414EX had been cleared to taxi ""right side out"" and to hold short of the taxiway. There is a stop sign at the intersection. The driver reportedly stopped before proceeding across the ramp. A bus passenger saw the aircraft approaching from the left and yelled three times for the driver to stop. The driver later said he thought the passenger was referring to an aircraft off to the right side. The first officer said the navigation lights, rotating beacon, and runway turnoff lights were operating. He saw ""something dark"" off to the right and yelled a warning to the captain. He did not see the bus' headlights. The flight engineer said she saw the bus, but ""the bus was hazy. It was not clearly discernible."" She did not see headlights or interior lights on the bus. The captain could not be interviewed. The left and right main tires left skid marks measuring 22 and 24 feet, respectively. The nose tire was pushed left and left a skid mark 16 feet in length. The nose section of the airplane was destroyed. The left front portion of the bus was damaged and the windshield was knocked out."
378,ACC1268,"The flight was an on-demand air charter on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). The Cessna Caravan was to carry out a return flight from Page (PGA) to Montrose County (MTJ). The return flight to Page was scheduled to depart Montrose at 17:00 on October 7, but was delayed to the next day because of bad weather en route. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed upon takeoff and a company visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan was used. The flight took off at 07:05 from runway 17 of the Montrose Airport which is located at an elevation of 5,759 feet msl (1762 m). While climbing through an altitude of 10,000 feet, the target airplane's course changed from southwest to northwest, back to southwest, and then made a sharp turn to the right. At an altitude of 15,400 ft msl the airplane entered an uncontrolled descent. It descended in a steep flight path angle (about -65 degrees) at an approximate flat pitch attitude, and little indication of forward speed. The Caravan struck terrain among 60-foot-high pine trees at the 9,900 foot (3030 m) level on the Uncompahgre Plateau."
379,ACC1269,"After a firm touchdown, there was a snapping noise and the left wing dropped. Suspecting a left main gear failure the pilot elected to overshoot with the intent of diverting to another airport with better facilities. The overshoot was successful. Then hydraulic pressure was lost and fuel quantity began to drop rapidly. The crew decided to return to land at Island Lake/Garden Hill Airport. The left gear collapsed and the aircraft slid off the runway. The left main gear drag links may have failed in overload. The pilot reported a very strong cross wind and that he touched down with crab."
380,ACC1270,"On the third day of flying operations in Papua New Guinea, the crew of the Darwin-based Twin Otter were conducting a flight from Madang and return via a number of airstrips in the central highlands. When haze and cloud prevented them flying the flight-planned direct track between the Koinambe and Simbai airstrips, they decided to fly north-west via the Jimi River valley and one of its tributaries. Two of the trainees were occupying the cockpit seats, one as flying pilot and the other as navigating pilot using a 1:1,000,000-scale chart. When the crew turned the aircraft to follow a tributary off the Jimi River, the training pilot was in the aircraft cabin. A few minutes later, their discussion regarding the progress of the flight attracted the attention of the training pilot. By this time, however, the position of the aircraft in the valley, and its available performance, were such that an escape from the valley was not possible. The aircraft collided with trees before impacting steeply sloping ground."
381,ACC1271,"During an IFR arrival, vectors were provided for an ILS runway 16L approach. While on assigned heading and altitude of 270 degrees and 3,000 feet, about 8 miles north of the final approach fix, the pilot was told to turn left to 185 degrees and maintain 2,200 feet until established on the localizer, then he was cleared for the approach. The pilot acknowledged the instructions. About 1 minute later, communication and radar contact with the airplane were lost. Eye witnesses near the accident site observed the airplane as it descended below the cloud layer. The airplane was described as being in a steep left bank with the nose down. Witnesses also stated that the engines were revving. Within seconds of the visual sighting, the airplane crashed. Examination of the airframe failed to disclose a mechanical problem. No fire or smoke was seen coming from the airplane before it crashed. The pilot did not report experiencing a problem with the airplane to the tower controller. Toxicology tests of the pilot indicated O.323 mcg/ml chlorpheniramine (a sedating antihistamine) in liver fluid and 0.073 mcg/ml chlorpheniramine in kidney fluid. Also, unspecified levels of dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant), pseudoephedrine (a decibgestabt), and phenylpropanolamine (a decongestant) were reported in kidney and liver fluids. All medications are available in over-the-counter cold remedies."
382,ACC1272,"The Metro III passenger plane touched down 800 m down the runway in night time VMC conditions. The copilot had difficulty maintaining direction and the captain assumed control. Nearing the end of the runway, the airplane was steered to the right with brakes and reverse being applied. The airplane ran onto the ground and the left hand prop struck a runway marker."
383,ACC1273,"The DC-8 cargo plane was being repositioned from Entebbe to Mwanza to collect 40 tons of frozen fish filets when crashed on landing.Reportedly, the PIC had no type rating on the aircraft because Aeroservice Miami had stopped his training as they were not making any progress. The aircraft landed at night, although Mwanza was a daytime-operations only airport at the time. The airplane touched down on the left of the runway after doing 3 missed approaches. It slid down the grass sideways onto the runway, collapsed both main gears and separated the number 3 engine which came to rest on fire under the forward hold of the aircraft."
384,ACC1274,The Caravan I returned to North Bay after encountering icing conditions. The aircraft struck the runway on landing.
385,ACC1275,"Bearskin Flight 310, a Beech 99, was inbound to Webequie Airport (YWP) on a scheduled passenger flight from Fort Hope Airport (YFH). The flight crew completed an approach to Webequie based on visual cues, GPS and ADF. The flight crew lowered the landing gear about three miles from the runway and set full flap on final approach. The captain reportedly initiated the flare at about 50 feet and the nose of the aircraft came up, but the descent was not arrested before the aircraft struck the runway. The aircraft's wings and tail reportedly had a small amount of residual ice at landing. Winds on the surface were northwest at five to ten knots but the winds aloft were reported to be easterly at up to 50 knots. Examination of the aircraft at the terminal building led the crew to call company maintenance for an inspection. Inspection of the aircraft revealed that the left wing spar was broken, the left wing skin was wrinkled and the left engine was drooping. There were no injuries reported."
386,ACC1276,"A Voyageur Airways Beechcraft A100 aircraft, C-GILM, was on a flight from Winnipeg International Airport Winnipeg International Airport, MB (YWG) to Sioux Lookout Airport, ON (YXL). The crew of two pilots and two paramedics had completed a medevac flight and were returning to Sioux Lookout without a patient on board. The weather was reported to be: wind 060 degrees at two knots, visibility three statute miles in freezing drizzle, and ceiling overcast at 400 feet AGL. The First Officer was at the controls as they attempted two full NDB approaches for runway 34, each of which resulted in a missed approach. The captain then took control of the aircraft and conducted a full NDB approach for runway 34. On final approach, the crew had the runway in sight and the aircraft was lined up, but the aircraft was high on the approach. The captain called for full flap and pushed the props up to help slow the aircraft down. The aircraft developed a high rate of descent that was not fully countered before the aircraft contacted the runway firmly with the left main landing gear. The aircraft was taxied part way to the company ramp before the aircraft began pulling to the left very noticeably. The scissors had failed and the main wheels were turned slightly off-line. While conducting a heavy-landing inspection, company maintenance and operational personnel determined that in addition to the damage to the scissors for the left main landing gear, the rear spar of the left wing had failed in the vicinity of a pass-through hole for the flap actuator. The damage is reported to be overload in nature and consistent with the effects of landing hard on the left main wheel. During the approaches, the aircraft was above cloud during the penetration turns and was only in cloud during the final approach phases. A small amount of ice accumulated on the aircraft while in cloud (about 1/8th to 1/4 inch on the spinner remained after landing) but the de-ice equipment was working and was used."
387,ACC1277,"Flight 301 departed St. Andrews at 14:15 CST on a 40-minute, scheduled flight to Little Grand Rapids. The flight was pilot self-dispatched and departed under visual flight rules (VFR) in controlled airspace. When the aircraft approached Little Grand Rapids, the crew received the unofficial airport weather report by radio from the airport manager. The weather was reported as a ceiling of 200 feet agl and a visibility of one statute mile, and the crew flew an instrument approach. A missed approach procedure was carried out and the aircraft climbed back above the cloud layer. The crew then heard that a company Piper Navajo had landed on runway 18, visibility on finals being 2 miles. The Bandeirante crew then began a second approach, descending to an altitude of 150 feet. The track followed by the aircraft was east of the normal approach path and at low level. Power was applied just before the aircraft banked rapidly to the left, followed by a nearly immediate right bank and impact with the terrain. The aircraft descended into the trees in a shallow left bank approximately 400 feet south and 1 600 feet to the east of the approach to runway 36. It was found a.o. out that at both takeoff and landing, the aircraft was about 1 000 pounds heavier than the relevant maximum allowable weight. Also, the GPS installed in C-GVRO was not approved as a primary navigational aid. The available information indicates that the flight crew used the GPS as a primary navigational aid during the last approach to Little Grand Rapids."
388,ACC1278,"Tajikistan Airlines Flight 3183 was a charter flight from Dushanbe (DYU) to Sharjah (SHJ). After entering the United Arab Emirates airspace, the crew of the Tu-154 contacted Dubai Approach. Traffic was handled by Dubai because Sharjah did not have a surveillance radar. The crew received radar vectors and consecutive descent clearances from 17000 to 10000, 6000 and 2500 feet with a corrective turn to the course of 190°.While the Tu-154 descended through a height of 3460 feet the crew were cleared further down to 1500 feet. At 1800 feet the aircraft entered an area of turbulence. The height of 1500 feet was reached at a point almost 16 km from the runway. The crew did not report reaching this height, but at the same time Dubai Approach instructed the crew to turn to a heading of 270 degrees in preparation for an ILS approach to runway 30.While turning to the right, at a speed of 400 km/h, the landing gear was lowered. As the aircraft descended through 820 ft, an aural ""bank angle"" warning sounded, which ceased as the crew decreased the bank angle from 20 degrees to 14°. Descending through 690 ft, the crew again encountered turbulence. While preparing the aircraft for the final approach and landing the crew did not pay attention to their altitude. Suddenly one of the crew members noticed that they were too low and requested power to be added, but it was too late.The aircraft struck desert terrain, broke up and caught fire."
389,ACC1279,The Ilyushin had been cleared for a runway 03L takeoff. The takeoff run was normal until VR. At VR the captain experienced high elevator stick forces and the plane failed to accelerate further. Takeoff was aborted and the aircraft overran the runway. The nosegear struck a threshold light and the left main gear leg collapsed after striking a concrete plinth. The no. 1 engine separated from the wing and a fire erupted. It appeared that the aircraft was overloaded by 5t and the forward CofG was outside limits.
390,ACC1280,"At an indicated airspeed of 45 knots during the takeoff roll, ice formed between the inner and outer windshield panes, with the icing following the flow of heated air through the windshield. The crew's forward visibility was obscured, and the takeoff was aborted. The captain reported that the airplane drifted left into snow berms on the side of the 4200 feet long by 85 feet wide runway and caught fire. The ""DC-6 Airplane Operating Manual"" used by two other companies states ""...Certain combinations of temperature and humidity will cause moisture to condense from the air between the windshield panels and settle on the inner surfaces of the glass, obscuring vision. Once formed, anti-icing airflow with heater operation will be required to clear the panels."" This language was not included in the Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) literature, nor in the flight handbook for the company operating the accident airplane."
391,ACC1281,The aircraft landed slightly past the normal touchdown point. It bounced twice before skidding and then weaved about the runway centre line. The aircraft overran the runway paved surface and crashed into a drain.
392,ACC1282,"The Antonov was carrying Taliban soldiers from Kandahar to Herat when bad weather at Herat made the crew decide to divert to Quetta, Pakistan. Fuel exhaustion caused the plane to crash 110 km N of Quetta. The Antonov disintegrated on impact. Some sources reported this plane being an An-12 of Ariana Afghan Airlines. This has not been confirmed. Antonov reported it to be an An-32."
393,ACC1283,"At 17:00 Alberta Citylink flight 933 took off from Calgary on a scheduled flight to Lloydminster. The crew planned a non-precision automatic direction finder (ADF) approach to runway 25 at Lloydminster with an overcast ceiling of 400 feet, visibility of 5 statute miles in blowing snow and mist, and the wind from 110 degrees true at 7 knots. When the aircraft was inbound, the flight service station (FSS) specialist reported that the visibility had decreased to 3 sm. The crew were aware of approximately to ¼ inch build-up of ice on the aircraft during descent and so planned for a flap 20 landing. The first officer was flying the approach from the right-hand seat while the captain was monitoring the instruments and looking outside the aircraft for visual contact with the runway environment. When the captain saw the runway from the minimum descent altitude (MDA), he took control for the landing. The aircraft was north of the extended centre line of runway 25. Flaps 35 was selected, the power was reduced to flight idle, a turn to regain the centre line was carried out, and a descent was commenced from MDA. The aircraft contacted the runway surface heavily, moving left to right. As a result, the left main landing gear collapsed. Both propellers struck the runway, and the left propeller separated from the engine. The aircraft slid along the runway on the belly pod for a distance of about 1 800 feet. The left wing contacted the snow on the edge of the runway, resulting in a turn of about 160 degrees. The evacuation took place immediately after the aircraft came to rest; all occupants escaped quickly through the right, over-wing exit.The aircraft was sold to Dodson International Inc. to be used for spares."
394,ACC1284,"The aircraft reportedly suffered a no. 2 engine failure on takeoff. The F-27 swerved to the right off the runway, collided with an embankment and caught fire."
395,ACC1285,"The airplane encountered freezing rain about 5 miles south of the Port Heiden Airport (PTH) while in cruise at 1200 feet msl, and rapidly accumulated ice on the airframe, wings, and windshield. The pilot said he initially changed altitude in an attempt to exit the icing conditions. Ice accumulation continued, so he elected to return to Port Heiden. While maneuvering to land at the airport, the airplane was unable to maintain altitude while at full engine power. The pilot related that any angle of bank resulted in the onset of prestall buffet. He stated that he decided to land on a frozen lake south of the airport. He said that the airplane did not reach the lake, ""mushed into the ground,"" and that when he attempted to flare to land, the left wing stalled."
396,ACC1286,"A Nicaraguan hijacked an Atlantic Airlines twin-engine aircraft with 21 persons on board shortly after takeoff from Bluefields Airport (BEF), Nicaragua. The aircraft was on a scheduled domestic flight to Corn Island Airport (RNI). Shortly after takeoff, the hijacker doused a passenger and a portion of the aircrafts interior with gasoline and threatened to ignite it if the plane did not divert to San Andres Island, Colombia. The pilots told the hijacker they did not have sufficient fuel to reach San Andres and convinced him to go to Puerto Limón Airport (LIO), Costa Rica. According to local press reports, the hijacker was arrested without incident by Costa Rican authorities upon his arrival. There were no injuries to passengers or crew members during this incident. The hijacker reportedly is mentally unstable and is an unemployed drug addict."
397,ACC1287,"The Shorts 360 departed Benbecula for the final leg of the day to Stornoway. Weather at Stornoway was report as: wind 260°/ 08 kt, visibility 15 km in light drizzle, cloud few at 800 feet and broken at 1,400 feet agl, temperature plus 7°C and QNH 1002 mb. The captain then briefed for a NDB/DME approach for runway 36. The initial approach was normal and the crew were VMC at a range of approximately 8 nm from the airfield. At this stage the captain was certain of his geographical position and, with the agreement of his first officer, decided to continue visually. Although they were in sight of the surface, there appeared to be some patchy cloud in the direction of the airfield and neither pilot could see the runway. Descent was continued and flaps set to 15 degrees. At that point the flight was level at the minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 430 feet amsl. Visual contact with the runway was acquired and the PAPI showed four whites. The captain considered going around, but, considering the length of Stornoway runway (7218 feet / 2200 m), decided to land. Full flaps were selected. On finals the speed fluctuated between +10 and -5 relating to the 103 kts landing speed. Touchdown was 'firm'. The crew heard a 'bang' and the left side of the aircraft went down. The airplane slewed to the left.The aircraft was considered damaged beyond repair and broken up at Exeter in March 1999."
398,ACC1288,"The Antonov landed at Nasir, but overshot the runway, plunging into the Sobat River. First Vice President al-Zubair Muhammad Saleh and several other government officials were killed in the accident.The wreckage was still extant on the river bank in 2012."
399,ACC1289,"A Learjet 23, N37BL, was substantially damaged when it landed gear up at the Oakdale, California, airport. Both pilots were not injured. The flight was operating on a familiarization and training flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed."
400,ACC1290,"When the crew boarded the aircraft in Hsinchu for the flight to Kaohsiung it had been a long and demanding day for the captain who was to fly the aircraft. He had been on duty more than 11 hours and performed nine flights. The accident flight, which was planned to be his last flight of the day, was to take place in darkness. The weather was above minima but IMC. During the pre-flight check the crew noted a failure in the RH Main Bus. This caused a number of systems to be unavailable, a.o.: the autopilot, the left hand EFIS, LH/RH Flight Director, LH RMI, EFIS Comparators, and the no. 2 engine anti-ice start bleed valve being open (as a result of this, the ITT on this engine was approximately 15°C higher than normal at selected power on this engine). Despite the fact that, according to the Minimum Equipment List (MEL), taking off for a flight with any of the Main Buses inoperative was not allowed, the captain decided to continue.During taxi to runway 05 the aircraft was cleared for a Chunan One (CN1) departure. The aircraft took off at 19:29:09. Because of the autopilot was not available, the captain now had to fly manually. In addition, the flying had to be performed without support from the yaw-damper that was also inoperative as a result of the RH Main Bus failure. This means that more active rudder control was required, while the DFDR-data shows that such input was not made.The more than 30°C ITT-split between the engines, of which approximately 15°C was caused by the RH Engine Anti-ice Start Bleed Valve being open, did have little effect on the behavior of the aircraft in the initial start-sequence. But when the crew, 30 seconds after lift off, disengaged CTOT and started to manually adjust the RH PLA downwards, possibly to get equal ITT in the engines, this ended up in a torque-split of more than 13% between the engines, with the RH engine being lower in torque. This asymmetry tended to yaw and roll the aircraft to the right and required higher aileron input than normal to the left in order to keep the aircraft at a constant bank angle. Normally the flaps are retracted at around 1,000 feet during initial climb. In this flight the flap retraction was not initiated until the first officer was reading the Climb Check List in which the flap position should be checked and verified. Flap retraction was done just prior to the aircraft reaching VFE15 (175 KIAS, which is the maximum allowed speed with flaps extended).When the climb power was set, a symmetric PLA change was made. However, due to the earlier RH Power Lever Angle (PLA) pull in combination with the normal backlash in the power lever cables between the PLA and the HMU, the RH engine torque was decreased while the LH engine torque remained unchanged. Hence, a torque split occurred. This resulted in an increased aerodynamic asymmetry giving a force tending to yaw and bank the aircraft to the right. Consequently, still more aileron input was required in order to maintain a correct bank angle.Because the behavior of the aircraft was very different from what the captain was used to, the need for continuous manual flying under IMC-conditions may have totally occupied his capacity. This could also explain why, during this phase of flight, he did not observe the aircraft starting a turn to the right 78 seconds after take off instead of continuing the left turn for a heading of 260. At about this same time, and for no obvious reasons, the positive rate of climb decreased and the aircraft leveled out at approximately 2,000 feet for a short time instead of continuing the climb to its assigned altitude of 3,000 feet. The captain's actions could be interpreted as signs that he might have been suffering from fatigue or spatial disorientation.It is difficult to determine if the F/O was aware of the captain's deviation from the cleared departure route. All indications point to the fact that he was not aware or that he out of respect for the captain did not report of the deviations. For example, the F/O transmitted back to Taipei Approach 114 seconds after takeoff, ""Left 230, Bravo 12255,"" while at the same time the aircraft was in a right turn with a 21 degree right bank, passing through a heading of 312 degrees. In fact, his primary means for monitoring the flight were very limited due to dark, IMC-conditions since his EFIS instruments were black or flagged. This could also explain why the captain did not receive any support from the F/O about the flight becoming more and more uncontrolled. Not until 124 seconds after takeoff and 37 seconds prior to the last DFDR-recording did the captain state that he was having a problem with the heading and asked for help with the magnetic compass. At that time the aircraft was in a 24° right bank and 10° pitch up position and had a heading and roll rate by one degree per second. From that moment a continuous decrease in pitch angle was recorded down to -65,4° just prior to the impact. Just 19 seconds before the last DFDR-recording, with a heading of 022 and a bank angle of 36° to the right, the captain said ""Ask for a radar vector."" At this moment, he also initiates a short aileron input to the right, further increasing the bank angle.The other crewmembers did not answer or give any notable response to the captain's request for help with the magnetic compass. The reason might be that they also were very confused about the situation and unable to take any relevant action. When the captain, 14 seconds before the last DFDR-recording, said ""Wah Sei!!! Everything is wrong."" the aircraft was in a 8,4° pitch down and the right bank angle was 47,5°. Finally, only 10 seconds before the last data point was recorded, the first officer responds by asking ""Sir, shall we look at this one? "". Pitch down was then 15,8° and the right roll angle 71,7°. In the last part of the flight the pitch and bank angles were at extreme values not to be experienced in normal operation. At this stage of the flight, the control inputs recorded are rapid aileron inputs to the right that further increased the adverse attitudes. The aircraft was then totally uncontrolled and the airspeed and sink rate increased dramatically. Four seconds before impact the Vmo warning started. The aircraft then crashed into the sea."

402,ACC1292,"Flight PR 137 was a regular scheduled passenger flight and departed Manila for Bacolod at 18:40. The airplane departed with the thrust reverser of engine no. 1 inoperative. At 19:20, PR137 called Bacolod Approach Control and reported passing FL260 and 55 DME to Bacolod . The crew then requested landing instructions and was instructed to descend to FL90 after passing Iloilo and descend to 3,000 ft for a VOR runway 04 approach. Wind was 030° at 08 kts, altimeter 1014 mbs, transition level at FL60 and temperature at 28°C. At 19:28, the flight requested to intercept the final approach to runway 04 and Approach Control replied ""PR 137 visual approach on final"". At 19:37, Bacolod Tower cleared the flight to land at runway 04 and the clearance was acknowledged by the pilot.The approach was flown with the Autothrust system was engaged in SPEED mode. The thrust lever of engine no.1 was left in Climb detent. Upon touchdown the first officer called out ""no spoilers, no reverse, no decel"". Engine no.2 was set to full reverse thrust after touchdown, but the engine no .1 thrust lever was not retarded to idle and remained in the climb power position. Consequently, the spoilers did not deploy. Because one engine was set to reverse, the autothrust system automatically disengaged. With the autothrust disengaged, no. 1 engine thrust increased to climb thrust. Due to the asymmetrical thrust condition, the A320 ran off the right side of the runway. At this speed, rudder and nosewheel steering are ineffective. Engine no.2 was moved out of reverse up to more than 70 percent N1 and the airplane swerved back onto the runway. The A320 continued past the runway end. The aircraft hit the airport perimeter fence and then jumped over a small river. It continued to slice through a hallow block fence where it went through several clusters of shanties and trees. No fire ensued after the crash."
403,ACC1293,"A Learjet 24B, N100DL, overran the end of runway 07 on landing roll at Orlando Executive Airport (ORL) in Orlando, Florida. The airplane was owned by AJM Airplane Company and operated by Panther Aviation for the purpose of transporting a human organ transplant team. The pilot, first officer and four passengers were not injured and the airplane received substantial damage.During landing roll, the airplanes normal braking system failed as a result of hydraulic fluid leak(s). At the pilot's request, deployment of the drag chute and application of the emergency braking system was performed by the first officer. According to the first officer, application of the emergency brakes caused the airplane to yaw. The first officer then pulled up on the emergency brakes handle followed by re-application of braking pressure. This action took place several times during the landing roll. Gates' Learjet Flight Training Manual (Page 105) states, 'In using the emergency brake lever, slow steady downward pressure is required. Each time the lever is allowed to return upward to the normal position, nitrogen is evacuated overboard. Brace your hand so you will not allow the lever to move up and down inadvertently on a bumpy runway.' The airplane overran the end of the runway and collided with the Instrument Landing System back course antennae."

He said the airplane was in cruise flight at 4,500 feet mean sea level while en route to Nome (OME). As the flight progressed southbound, the ceilings continued to lower, and the pilot said he descended to 2,500 feet. About 12 miles 919 km) north of Nome, the pilot indicated he descended to 1,500 feet, and the visibility was between 3 to 4 miles. At 15:15, about 6 miles 910 km) north of Nome, the pilot contacted the Nome Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS), and obtained an airport advisory.

411,ACC1301,"Airbus G-UKLL was operated by Leisure International Airways and used to operate a holiday charter flight on behalf of Sabre Airways from Manchester to Ibiza. Flight 4064 departed at 22:30, some 15 minutes behind the planned schedule. The handling pilot for the sector was the first officer; this was decided during the pre-flight briefing, given the good meteorological conditions expected at destination. As soon as the Ibiza METAR had been obtained, while still in the cruise phase, the first officer planned for an ILS approach to runway 24, set up the navigation aids and programmed the Flight Management Guidance Computers (FMGC's) accordingly. He pre-selected the BSCU (Brake and Steering Control Unit) Autobrake system to Low. Upon this selection, a 'BRAKES BSCU CH 2 FAULT' was annunciated to the crew. There was no ECAM procedure to be followed. The selection was repeated but the fault remained. The Status Page displayed 'Inop Sys BSCU2 Fault' ('Inoperative System, BSCU Channel 2 Fault'). The crew checked the relevant section of the Flight Crew Operating Manual Volume 3 and this stated that the indication was for' Crew Awareness'. No further crew action was specified. At 00:46 hrs the crew were authorised to land on runway 24, wind of 020deg at 5 knots. The aircraft made the flare and a gentle touchdown about 800 metres from the start of runway 24. A slight tailwind component was apparent, of approx. 4 kt. Reverse thrust was selected and initial deceleration appeared normal. The commander considered that more braking was required in order to slow the aircraft to achieve the planned turn off the runway, so he advised the first officer to apply more braking.The first officer tried to apply more braking but found this ineffective. He informed the commander of this and, around 80 kt, the first officer reduced reverse thrust. The commander immediately took control, reapplied reverse thrust and attempted to apply the brakes. He too found that there was no braking available. Therefore, the commander began to swerve the aircraft each way in an attempt to increase the available braking distance and slow the aircraft down by lateral skidding before reaching the end of the runway, with the tyres leaving rubber marks on the runway surface. The aircraft left the end of the runway, entering the paved stopway and then into and beyond the 60 m overrun area. The captain elected to turn the aircraft to the right to remain within the aerodrome boundary. The nose landing gear collapsed as the aircraft ran on softer and more rugged terrain to approach an earth embankment and then came to rest with both engines partially embedded in it."
412,ACC1302,"Three hijackers armed with handguns and claiming to have explosives ordered the crew to fly to India. The hijackers also demanded (U.S.) $20 million for development in their native Baluchistan Province. Rather than fly to India, however, the crew took the plane to the airport in Hyderabad, Pakistan, located 90 miles from Karachi. The hijackers were led to believe that they had landed at a remote airstrip in Bhoj, India. Upon landing, the plane was immediately surrounded by security forces and vehicles were parked in front to prevent it from leaving. More than five hours later the hijackers reportedly told thenegotiators that Baluchistan needed development funds rather than nuclear tests by the Pakistani government in response to five Indian nuclear tests two weeks before. The hijackers agreed to release the women and children aboard the aircraft. As the passengers were deplaning, Pakistani commandos overpowered the hijackers.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight plan had been cancelled prior to initiating the visual approach. The flight originated at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Washington, about 13:50 local time.The accident flight was the first officer's second Initial Operating Experience (IOE) training flight after being hired by Alaska Airlines. The first officer was making a visual approach to runway 26, and on initial touchdown the airplane ""skipped"" and became airborne. The captain said that during the initial touchdown he noted that the throttles were not in the fully retarded position. At this point, the captain closed the throttles and instructed the first officer to maintain attitude as the second touchdown approached. He said that the auto spoilers then deployed, and the airplane settled onto the runway in a nose high attitude. The captain characterized the second touchdown as ""firm"", but well within acceptable limits. A subsequent inspection by ground personnel discovered a 4 feet by 1 foot scrape located on the belly of the airplane, between stations 887 and 941. The airplane was later flown to Seattle, unpressurized, for further inspection, and repair. Maintenance personnel were required to replace a 2 feet by 7 feet section of aircraft skin, prior to returning the airplane to service. The FDR readout showed that the first flare attained a pitch angle of 7 degrees. After the ""skip,"" the pitch angle was lowered to 5 degrees, and then raised to about 8 degrees.

In addition, the fuel truck was damaged. There were no injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the international passenger flight that originated in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, at 16:41. 	Flight 1722 was about 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule. The airplane landed on runway 27R, and exited the runway to the right at a high speed turnoff, K-4. The airplane continued with a right turn and passed through intersection Oscar, headed straight toward the alleyway entrance between concourses A and B. Flight 1722 was cleared to change from tower frequency, to ground control, and then to US Airways ramp control. The flight was scheduled to arrive at gate B-8. 	The operator of the refueling truck had recently transferred experienced drivers, including the accident driver, from other airports to increase the work force at Philadelphia. The accident driver first received 2 days of on the job training, which included riding with another driver.

He reported that he had serviced an airplane on the west side of concourse A. As he approached the alleyway entrance between concourses A and B, he observed a US Airways B737 to his right just outside of the outer service road. 	The investigation revealed that the outer service roadway crossed the alleyway entrance between concourses A and B. Printed on the roadway in white letters was, ""STOP FOR AIRCRAFT."" According to airport operations personnel, a driver would not be expected to stop if no aircraft were present. Vehicle drivers were instructed that airplanes have the right of way.	Additionally, the investigation revealed that the US Airways B737 parked adjacent to concourse A would have obstructed the fuel truck driver's view of the approaching DC-9, and the flight crew's view of the fuel truck, until the fuel truck had passed from behind the airplane. Visibility to the right was further restricted for the fuel truck driver by refueling hoses located to the right of the cab. 	At the time of the accident, the fuel truck had driven 150 feet ahead of the STOP FOR AIRCRAFT sign.

428,ACC1318,"The crew left Sheffield in VP-CKM at 06:22 hrs for their flight planned destination of Fairoaks with London Heathrow Airport as an alternate. By 06:50 hrs they were in contact with the Aerodrome Flight Information Service Officer (AFISO) at Fairoaks but the AFISO advised the crew not to land until the normal operating time at 07:00 hrs when the airfield would have fire cover available. The current weather was reported to the crew by the AFISO as follows: Sky clear; mist with a visibility of 1,200 metres; surface wind 060° less than 5 kt; QNH 1002 mb and QFE 1005 mb. The commander, who was the handling pilot, approached the airfield on a track of 060° using the Fairoaks Non-directional Radio Beacon (NDB) and the aircraft's Flight Management System (FMS), and descended to 1,000 feet agl with the intention of landing on runway 06. However, neither pilot saw the airfield until they were overhead and, in agreement with the AFISO, decided to make an approach to runway 24 because of better visibility in that direction. The AFISO switched on the Abbreviated Precision Approach Path Indicators (APAPIs) for runway 24 and the commander flew a tear drop pattern to the east of the airfield and then established the aircraft on a track of 240° towards the airfield. During the pattern, the gear had been selected down and the flaps set to an intermediate position. At 1.8 nm DME range, the co-pilot saw the APAPIs slightly left of the aircraft nose and pointed them out to the commander; at the time, the co-pilot recalled that the APAPIs were showing 'two whites', the aircraft was at 1,000 feet agl and at 124 kt IAS. By now, the crew had been advised to land at their discretion with the wind calm. Subsequently, full flap was selected and the commander noted his speed on short finals as 104 kt. As VP-CKM approached the threshold, the commander called for the deployment of speedbrakes; as the co-pilot deployed the speedbrakes, he noted the DME range as 0.5 nm and that the FMS indicated a tailwind of 5 kt. The commander considered that touchdown was positive and just beyond the threshold; the co-pilot considered that touchdown was just past the APAPIs.Immediately after touchdown, the commander selected full thrust reverse on both engines and applied moderate wheel braking. Initially, he considered that the retardation seemed adequate but then seemed to reduce. The co-pilot was not aware of retardation and remembered applying maximum brake pedal pressure while noticing that the runway was damp and seemed ""shiny"".When he realised that he could not stop the aircraft before the end of the runway, the commander stowed the thrust reversers and attempted to close down the engines. During the later part of the landing run, the co-pilot heard a call of ""going round"" and saw the commander stow the thrust reversers.After leaving the runway, the aircraft travelled for 250 metres before coming to rest. The passenger evacuated through the cabin escape hatch and the co-pilot followed him after an unsuccessful attempt to open the normal cabin door. The co-pilot was then able to open the cabin door from the outside and assist the commander to leave. The commander had sustained back injuries and the copilot had received some cuts and bruises.On seeing the aircraft going off the runway, the AFISO alerted the AFS who, because of the misty conditions, had positioned at the threshold of runway 24. The AFS followed the track of VP-CKM and on arrival at the crash scene, where there was a strong smell of fuel with smoke emanating from the engines, covered the aircraft with foam. The AFS moved the aircraft occupants well clear of the wreckage and remained on the scene. Prior to departure, the commander checked the landing distance required for the expected weight of VP-CKM at Fairoaks and calculated that he had 30 to 40 metres longer than required based on zero surface wind. This calculation was subsequently confirmed as reasonable for a landing on runway 24. However, at the time of landing there was a slight tailwind and the runway was not dry.The aircraft had sustained serious damage. The landing gear was torn off, the left wing tip removed, and extensive impact damage to fuselage underside, wings and tail. There was heavy FOD ingestion damage to the right engine. The wreck was sold 5 February 1999 to Dodson International Parts Inc & to Ultra Acquisitions Ltd and rebuilt as N561JS."

431,ACC1321,"The Skyvan was used for paradropping flights out of Zell am Zee, Austria. At 13:54 the airplane returned from a dropping flight. With the engines running, 19 skydivers boarded the plane through the rear ramp. The pilot then taxied to runway 25, selected flaps to 30 degrees and commenced takeoff. The friction locks of the throttles were not or not properly set prior to takeoff. Due to the vibration of the airplane the throttles slowly retarded during the takeoff roll. At a VR speed of 65kts the pilot pulled back on the controls and the Skyvan left the ground. Immediately after takeoff the airplane rolled and yawed to the left. The pilot pushed the throttles forward and tried to correct the roll. The airplane now rolled 40 degrees to the right and collided with the ground."
432,ACC1322,"During takeoff, a military minibus suddenly crossed the runway. A collision occurred, killing 4 occupants of the bus."
433,ACC1323,The DC-3 was on a flight from Playa Grande when it crashed into mountainous terrain near Quetzaltenango Airport. Instrument meteorological conditions (thick fog and rain) prevailed and no flight plan was reported filed. The bad weather was due to the tropical depression Mitch. The plane carried doctors from the Christian Agua Viva missionary group who had done medical relief work in Playa Grande.
434,ACC1324,"A McDonnell Douglas MD-11, N801DE, experienced a tail strike while landing at Portland International Airport, Oregon. The flight was landing on runway 10R after arriving from Cincinnati, Ohio. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight plan had been filed. There were no injuries to the 11 crew members or 113 passengers, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage to the belly skin and stringers. The flight crew stated that they were unaware the aircraft had experienced a tail strike until maintenance personnel at the arrival gate advised them that there was damage to the number 3 VHF antenna and the skin aft of the antenna mount. After the passengers were deplaned normally through the jetway, the damage was further evaluated, and it was determined that the aircraft would need to be ferried to Atlanta for permanent repair.During the investigation, it was determined that the weight existing in the Flight Management System (FMS) during the approach and landing sequence was in error approximately 100,000 pounds. As confirmed by a review of the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) readout, the FMS weight was about 292,000 pounds, when in fact the actual aircraft landing weight was approximately 392,000 pounds. This error generated a final approach speed of 136 knots for an approach that should have been flown at 151 knots. This reduced speed resulted in the approach being flown at an eight (8) degree pitch attitude instead of the three to four degrees that would occur during an approach flown at the correct airspeed. The FDR data also showed that approximately 7 seconds before nose gear strut compression, the pitch attitude reached 10.9 degrees. Although the exact FMS entry error was not determined, the most likely would be the crew missing the hundred thousand entry by one when inputting the takeoff gross weight, entering the empty weight into the zero fuel weight prompt, or entering the zero fuel weight in the aircraft takeoff gross weight prompt."
435,ACC1325,"An Asiana Boeing 747-400 (HL-7414) taxied to the gate (N-6) at Anchorage for a refueling stop on the flight Seoul-New York (flight 211). While trying to make a U-turn, the Boeing's no. 1 engine struck the wing of an Aeroflot Ilyushin, parked at a gate. Immediately thereafter the left wing struck the forward side of the Ilyushin's tail. The Asiana crew added more power causing the wing to cut through nearly half of the tail of the Russian aircraft. The maximum ground speed recorded by the on-board recorders was 16 knots, while according to the company flight manual it should have been ""10 knots or below (5 knots if wet or slippery)""."
436,ACC1326,"After takeoff from Lago Argentino (ING), the crew noted a red warning light, indicating that the left hand main landing gear was not properly retracted. A visual inspection from the cabin revealed that the landing gear was retracted so the crew continued to Río Gallegos (RGL). On approach the left main gear did not deploy. Manual extension did not work and the crew decided to carry out a belly landing. An approach with full flaps was flown and the propellers were feathered shortly before the Metro II touched down."
437,ACC1327,"Regency Express Air flight 434 was on a night cargo flight from Vancouver (YVR) to Victoria (YYJ) and was operating under VFR. The aircraft departed from Vancouver's runway 08R at 00:12 PST and completed a climbing right-hand turn onto a direct track towards Active Pass. The aircraft leveled off at 2000 feet agl and remained at that altitude for all but the last portion of the flight. As the aircraft approached Active Pass, the crew made a radio call to inform any traffic in the Victoria area of their intention to join left-base for a landing on runway 09 at the Victoria airport. Several minutes later, the crew made a second report indicating that they were 10 nm (18,5 km) back, for a landing on runway 09. The last position report was made as they approached Beaver Point, at the south-east end of Saltspring Island. The aircraft then made a noticeable turn to the right, in the vicinity of Beaver Point, and began to track towards high ground north of the Victoria airport. At 00:26, the aircraft began a gradual, descending turn to the left onto a south-easterly heading, before striking trees near the peak of Mount Tuam on the southern end of Saltspring Island."
438,ACC1328,"A float-equipped Cessna Caravan, 5N-PAN, departed Lagos (LOS) on a chartered flight to Warri with a scheduled stop-over at Lekki. The aircraft was airborne at 07:34 hours UTC and was cleared to 1,000ft by Lagos Tower and landed at Lekki at 07:42 hours UTC. At 08:20 hours UTC, the aircraft departed Lekki and called Lagos Approach which cleared it to 3,500ft with further instructions for the aircraft to report at TMA. The aircraft reported at TMA and continued its normal flight at 3,500ft. On contact with Escravos Tower, it requested for a descent from 3,500ft to 700ft in order to over-fly the Chevron facility at Opuekaba for an aerial inspection. After the inspection, the aircraft was cleared to 2,500ft to resume its normal flight to Warri.The pilot made an out-bound turn to line up for the final approach to runway 03. At about 5 nm DME from Warri the pilot chose to reduce speed to 120 knots and he selected gear down with flap 15°.At 3 nautical miles out, the aircraft was about 900 feet high above the approach path, and cleared to land. The aircraft was now configured for landing with flap at 30° and the pilot reduced the speed to between 85 and 90 knots.At about 1.5 miles out, the aircraft was between 350 - 400ft high, gliding with 400 lb of torque, the pilot felt a small shudder from the engine which was instantaneously followed by a need for power input, so he advanced the throttle but there was no response from the engine. He quickly retracted the flaps and feathered the propeller.Then the pilot re-selected flap 30° and also unfeathered the propeller which restored the engine to full torque. The pilot decided to abandon the approach mainly because of the a building structure ahead, close to the runway threshold. The pilot chose to veer the airplane to the left of the approach path centerline and ditched into the swampy terrain, cutting through some scattered trees and shrubbery."
439,ACC1329,"The Dash 7 plane had been in Egypt for 2,5 years, but had been stored there for some time. The aircraft was then re-possessed by DNK Leasing, registered in the Cayman Islands and ferried to Guernsey for extensive maintenance. The aircraft remained out of service at Guernsey airport for approximately one year whilst it underwent an extensive programme to ensure that all maintenance required during the previous two years had been fully implemented. This was found to be necessary because the extent of the work carried out during its period in Egypt was not clearly defined by the supporting documentation. The initial test flight was flown on 25 November 1998, and was satisfactory except that the aircraft did not achieve the requisite climb performance. It was established that No 3 engine was not producing the rated power. This engine was changed and an abbreviated test flight was planned for the 28 November 1998; it was intended that this flight would only cover those elements related to aircraft performance. Descending from FL100 , at around 7000 feet the no. 1 engine was shutdown. The other three operating engines were at a low power setting. The autopilot was engaged and the flaps were up. The aircraft was then leveled at 5000 feet. As the autopilot attempted to maintain level flight, the pitch attitude increased and the airspeed reduced at a rate of about 1×5 kt. At about 95 KIAS, with the autopilot still engaged and the elevator and the pitch trim continuing to provide a positive pitch-up demand, the pitch attitude started to decrease. The maximum pitch attitude achieved was 8°. The onset of vibrations occurred at about 97 KIAS. Coincident with this was a slight forward movement of the elevator, prior to this the elevator and pitch trim were consistently moving nose up together. The autopilot was not disconnected until 6 seconds later.The power was then increased on all three operating engines and the autopilot was disconnected. The elevator was 12° and the pitch trim 16.4°, both positive (pitch up) demands. The airspeed was 89 KIAS. The power continued to increase on the three operating engines and the aircraft began to roll to the left to a maximum of 80° angle of bank and this was opposed by the use of up to 54° right spoiler. The pitch attitude reduced to 54° nose down. Power was than reduced on the operating engines. The maximum rate of rotation about the yaw axis was 60°/sec. The DHC-7 spiraled down, crashed nose-down into a field and burst into a flames. The Dash 7 came down close to the A38 at Bickington near Ashburton."
440,ACC1330,"Rolled to an inverted position and crashed 17 miles south of the departure airport, Mena, AR. The reason for the loss of control was not determined."
441,ACC1331,"At 15:36, the power levers were advanced to the takeoff power range. V1 was called, and rotation was initiated at the target rotation speed (VR) of 115 KIAS, with approximately 3700 feet of runway remaining. The elevator was deflected, and the nose began to pitch up. The captain relaxed the elevator controls somewhat when the aircraft approached what he thought was the takeoff attitude. When the aircraft did not get airborne as expected, he pulled back on the controls a second time. The aircraft had reached 121 KIAS, with 2800 feet remaining during the second attempt. The aircraft did not get airborne and the captain called for a reject as the aircraft accelerated through 127 KIAS. He retarded the power levers as the aircraft reached a speed of 131 KIAS and was approximately 1750 feet from the end of the runway. The captain applied full braking, and the full-fine pitch stop lever was applied for aerodynamic braking. When it became apparent that the aircraft would not stop on the runway, the captain steered the aircraft to the left in an attempt to avoid the localizer antenna. The aircraft was traveling at approximately 100 knots as it went off the end of the runway. As the aircraft rolled through the soft ground, the nose-wheel gear collapsed. The right wing hit the localizer antenna, and the aircraft continued skidding on its belly through heavy rocks. It came to rest in a nose-down attitude approximately 800 feet off the declared end of the runway."
442,ACC1332,"Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft, which was climbing at approximately 500 feet above sea level, pitched up suddenly and became unstable when the flaps were retracted while entering the cloud layer. The pilot-in-command pushed the control column down to level the aircraft. After deciding that the aircraft could not safely continue the flight, he began turning left to return to Baie-Comeau. While turning, the aircraft rolled rapidly to the left and began to dive. The aircraft crashed into the St. Lawrence River."
443,ACC1333,"The HAL-748 plane crashed in a dense forest, 2,5 km from the Arakkonam NAS. The HAL-748 was converted to carry a rotordome, which would ultimately house the in-built radar, on top. Preliminary reports suggest the dome collapsed on top of the aircraft, since the dome was found 2 km from the runway."
444,ACC1334,"Returning from an operational aerial refueling mission, the aircraft pitched up to a near vertical attitude and subsequently stalled and crashed.The pitch up was the direct result of the horizontal stabilizer trim being in a 7.5 nose-up trim condition when the aircraft was given power to complete a go around prior to landing. The apparent cause is now understood to be a runaway trim motor, the crew failed to notice, and when power was applied, the aircraft pitched up and stalled. The cause of the runaway motor is still unknown."
445,ACC1335,"Douglas DC-3C C-GWUG, was usually used on cargo flights between Vancouver and Nanaimo. Because of delayed arrival of a Purolator Boeing 727, the route of C-GWUG was changed to Vancouver-Victoria-Nanaimo, operating for Purolator Courier.Vancouver tower cleared the aircraft for takeoff at 06:22 PST from runway 26L. After takeoff, the aircraft turned left on a track toward Active Pass. During the departure climb, the captain requested an altitude of 1000 feet above sea level; the tower controller approved this request. The aircraft left the Vancouver control zone at 06:26 and entered Class E (controlled) airspace. As the aircraft approached the Gulf Islands, it descended slightly and remained level at 900 feet asl. It crossed about 0.25 nm west of the Active Pass NDB at 06:32 while remaining steady at 130 knots (ground speed) and level at 900 feet asl.At 0633:04, the aircraft descended to 800 feet asl for about nine seconds. The last radar data show the aircraft at 900 feet asl and 130 knots. At this altitude he aircraft initially struck trees on the ridge of Mount Parke and cut a swath through the treetops of about 200 feet long and 70 feet wide. After passing through the trees on the ridge top, the aircraft continued over a cliff in the direction of flight for approximately 1100 feet while dropping about 600 feet to the valley floor."
446,ACC1336,"The flight apparently proceeded normally until late final approach when the pilot initiated a go-around because of a vehicle on the airstrip. The aircraft rolled and yawed left, descended steeply and crashed onto a tidal flat."
447,ACC1337,"The aircraft climbed steeply to 450 feet (140 m) after takeoff. The Caravan then stalled, crashed in a left wing low attitude and caught fire.The fire could not be extinguished because the fire fighting equipment was not available at the site. The mobile extinguisher that was present in Jumla Tower was still in packed condition."
448,ACC1338,Crashed 15 minutes after taking off from Hoskins en route to Kandrian. It broke-up in mid-air after encountering severe weather and crashed into a oil palm plantation in flat terrain.
449,ACC1339,Flight 91 departed Anchorage at 21:45 for an IFR cargo flight to Saint Mary's. The pilot was cleared for a runway 16 LOC/DME approach at 23:25. Ten minutes later the aircraft crashed and broke into three. The pilot seats were found 50feet in front of the cockpit section. The wreckage was found at 04:00 the following morning.
450,ACC1340,"The flight departed Tonopah at 09:30 for a 73-mile VFR flight to Bishop. The aircraft was not carrying cargo at the time of the accident. The Beech failed to arrive at the destination; search efforts were initiated and the wreckage was subsequently found February 14 on the eastern slopes of White Mountain in the Inyo National Forest at 9,500 feet. A witnesses observed the aircraft flying between 7,000 and 8,000 feet msl as it entered Trace Plumas Canyon on White Mountain and begin a gradual left turn. The aircraft then disappeared from view. The canyon leads to the accident site. According to the operator, the pilot had successfully bid on a captain position on larger equipment and this was to be his last trip along this route. Several acquaintances of the pilot located at Tonopah reported that he intended to take a camera with him and photograph some scenic locations along this route."
451,ACC1341,The aircraft landed hot and downwind. It failed to stop on the runway and overran down through some tree stumps. The airstrip is located roughly 100nm NNW of Malakal. The aircraft carried freight for the SPLA troops in the Nuba mountains.
452,ACC1342,"A Mitsubishi MU-300, N110DS, overran runway 32 (5,680'x100') at the Columbus Municipal Airport, Nebraska, while landing. The pilot-in-command, co-pilot, and six passengers were not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The flight originated from San Jose, California, at 07:00 pacific standard time.The pilots flew the VOR DME RWY 32 approach then circled over the runway to check conditions. The airplane overshot the turn onto final approach and witnesses recalled seeing the airplane in a steep left bank on final approach. Witnesses reported the airplane then touched down approximately 3,000 feet down the 5,682' long runway. The airplane traveled off the end of the runway into snow covered terrain where the nose gear and forward fuselage area were damaged. The runway was plowed just prior to the accident; however braking action was still reported as poor."
453,ACC1343,The Beechcraft landed at Frankfurt runway 25L with its landing gear retracted. The crew did not use the Before Landing checklist and silenced the landing gear warning horn when it sounded.
454,ACC1344,"China Southwest Airlines flight SZ4509, a Tupolev Tu-154M, departed Chengdu Airport in China at 14:35 hours on a domestic flight to Wenzhou. The en route altitude was 11400 meters. At 16:02 hours, when the aircraft passed 9000 meters in the descent towards Wenzhou, the crew felt that the steering column was too far forward. The crew were puzzled by the control issue, especially at 16:26 hours when the steering column was fully forward. Yet, the aircraft was not in a nose-down attitude. The captain noted that the controls felt disconnected. At 16:29 the flight was cleared to descend from 1200 m to 700 m. When the flight crew selected the first stage of flaps, an angle-of-attack warning sounded in the cockpit.  The aircraft entered a stall and began a steep descent until it impacted a farm field at Rui'an.Several farmers were injured by the flying debris."
455,ACC1345,"A Douglas DC-9-15F, N195US, operated by USA Jet Airlines encountered a flock of snow geese, while on final approach for landing at Kansas City International Airport, Missouri. During the encounter, several birds were ingested into both engines, resulting in a severe power loss. The pilot managed to regain enough thrust on one engine to continue the approach and land the airplane without further incident. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the encounter. The flight originated at Los Angeles, California, at 18:25 pacific standard time (pst), and was en route to Kansas City, Missouri."
456,ACC1346,"A Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II, N151SA, operating as Superior Aviation flight 1828, and another Swearingen SA226TC, N328BA, operating as HKA flight 1810, both owned and operated by Superior Aviation, collided while taxiing at Denver International Airport, Colorado. There were no injuries.According to the pilot of N328BA, the aircraft's wings and tail section were partially deiced at the ramp by ramp personnel before they ran out of de-icing fluid. He received taxi clearance from ramp control and asked the de-icing crew to meet him on the south end of taxiway A to finish de-icing the remainder of the aircraft. He received instructions to hold short on taxiway A, and to contact ground control. Prior to reaching the taxiway hold short lines, he contacted ground control and received a clearance to taxi to runway 17R via taxiway M. He stated that because he received clearance to taxi to the runway, he did plan on stopping at the hold short lines. Immediately after receiving his taxi clearance, he realized he had forgotten to advise ramp control that he needed to deice the aircraft. At that time, he looked up and noticed that N151SA had stopped in front of him. He stated that he applied brake pressure, but was unable to stop. Upon impact, the left propeller of N328BA struck the tail section of N151SA, causing substantial damage to the left side of the fuselage of N151SA extending from the cargo door aft. In addition, the right flap of N151SA was damaged by N328BA's nose section. N328BA received minor damage to the left propeller, the left forward side of the fuselage, and the nose wheel well."
457,ACC1347,"Flight 960 operated under a defense visual flight rules flight plan and departed Goose Bay for Davis Inlet at 08:15 AST. During the first approach, the first officer had occasional visual glimpses of the snow on the surface. The captain descended the aircraft to the minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 1340 feet asl. When the crew did not acquire the required visual references at the missed approach point, they executed a missed approach. On the second approach, the captain flew outbound from the beacon at 3000 feet asl until turning on the inbound track. It was decided that if visual contact of the surface was made at any time during the approach procedure, they would continue below the MDA in anticipation of the required visual references. The captain initiated a constant descent at approximately 1500 feet per minute with 10 degrees flap selected. The FO occasionally caught glimpses of the surface. At MDA, in whiteout conditions, the captain continued the descent. In the final stages of the descent, the FO acquired visual ground contact; 16 seconds before impact, the captain also acquired visual ground contact. At 8 seconds before impact, the crew selected maximum propeller revolutions per minute. The aircraft struck the ice in controlled flight two nm from the airport. The aircraft was destroyed with wing and partial fuselage separation, and other incursion damage. The tail section where the ELT was mounted was badly damaged. Aircraft parts and cargo were scattered over the ice. The co-pilot was found approximately 20 feet from the main wreckage. He had expired before searchers reached the scene. The pilot was located in the rear of the aircraft, apparently thrown there during the crash sequence. He was semi-conscious with serious injuries. There was no fire."
458,ACC1348,"The airplane touched down about 1/3 beyond the approach end of runway 28, a 5,000 foot-long, asphalt runway. The captain applied light braking and attempted to actuate the thrust reversers; however, the reverser handles could not be moved beyond the 'Deploy-Reverse-Idle' position. After the captain cycled the levers two or three times, he began to apply maximum braking. The airplane overran the runway and came to rest on a plateau about 90 feet below the runway elevation."
459,ACC1349,"Samoa Air flight 906, a DHC-6-200, N719AS, veered off the runway and collided with a ditch and an embankment while landing at Fitiuta, Tu'a, American Samoa. The aircraft sustained substantial damage; however, neither of the 2 flight crewmembers nor any of their 12 passengers were injured. The flight originated from Pago Pago, American Samoa, at 06:09 as a regularly scheduled non-stop domestic passenger flight to Fitiuta. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and a composite IFR/VFR flight plan was filed.The captain overflew the Fitiuta airfield to assess winds conditions and the windsock indicated a quartering headwind for runway 12. During rollout the airplane veered immediately right when the power levers were brought into beta. The captain corrected with rudder and braking but was unable to maintain directional control. The aircraft ran off the right side of the runway and collided with a ditch and an embankment. After deplaning, the crew found that the winds were a 60-degree tailwind on runway 12. The windsock's pivot point on the pole was rusted and would not rotate. The aircraft with the same landing weight and a 60-degree 10-knot tailwind would require a 1,600-foot landing roll on the 2,350-foot runway without the assistance of both props in beta. The beta pin had backed out of position on the left engine's beta control linkage. The beta pin, cotter pin, and washer were found in the bottom of the engine cowling. The left engine had been changed 2 days prior to the accident. As the mechanics finished the beta pin area during engine installation, the inspector checked the area and found that the pin was in place and properly safety wired. Following the inspector's signoff of the area, the mechanics discovered that the teleflex cable was too short for the beta valve to be flushed and subsequently had to be adjusted. The director of maintenance readjusted the cable, which required disturbing the safety wire on the beta pin. One of the two mechanics that had been instructed to re-safety the connections after the adjustment thought that the rear portion had already been safetied and did not recheck the area. The inspector believed the area had already been checked and did not re-examine the beta pin."
460,ACC1350,The Mexican Air Force Boeing 737 was on a training flight when it overran the runway. The nosegear collapsed. Grass near the aircraft caught fire causing the airplane to burn out.
461,ACC1351,"A Beechcraft 100 King Air, N924RM, landed on runway 6 with the right main gear up, veered off the runway, and collided with a ditch at the Hickory Regional Airport, North Carolina. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight departed Richmond, Virginia, at 21:50.As the flight approached Hickory, the pilot was issued a visual approach clearance. Upon entering the traffic pattern for a full stop landing, the pilot completed the before-landing checklist, which included lowering the landing gear. When the landing-gear handle was placed in the down position, the right main landing gear did not extend. The pilot and the right seat passenger/pilot attempted several times to lower the right main gear but failed. The pilot decided to land with all gear in the up position; however, the left main gear and the nose wheel did not retract when the gear handle was placed in the up position. The airplane landed on the left main landing gear and the nose wheel. As the speed of the airplane slowed, the right wing settled to the runway and the airplane veered off the right side of the runway. The airplane came to rest after colliding with a five-foot deep ditch."
462,ACC1352,"A Beechcraft 99A, N133BA, sustained substantial damage when the airplane's left main landing gear collapsed during landing roll at the Bemidji-Beltrami County Airport, Minnesota. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The local systems flight test originated at Bemidji, Minnesota, at 17:40.Following takeoff and raising the landing gear, the red warning light in the landing gear handle failed to go out. The pilot said that he recycled the landing gear, but could not get the red light to go out. The pilot said that he continued with the test flight. On his return to the airport the pilot said he put the landing gear handle down and nothing happened. He recycled the handle two additional times with no results. The pilot overflew the airport and confirmed with his company's maintenance that the landing gear were still up. The pilot said that he then manually pumped the landing gear down, but only the nose gear and right main gear green indicator lights illuminated. The pilot overflew the airport again. His company's maintenance told him that the three gear were down. The pilot came into land. He said that he touched down on the right main gear first, and then gently lowered the left main gear to the runway. The landing gear held. The pilot said he then tried to apply some reverse thrust. Suddenly, the left main gear collapsed, and the left wing struck the runway. The airplane slid off of the left side of the runway and came to a stop in the grass."
463,ACC1353,Crashed into a swampy area at the end of the runway during a regular training mission. One of the airplane's two engines had lost power.
464,ACC1354,The aircraft crashed after takeoff from the Ol Kiombo airstrip in the Maasai Mara National Reserve to pick up passengers at another camp. Preliminary investigation results show that the flaps might not have been properly set for takeoff
465,ACC1355,"American Airlines Flight 1420, from Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) to Little Rock (LIT), was scheduled to depart about 20:28 and arrive about 21:41. However, the airplane originally intended to be used for the flight was delayed in its arrival to Dallas/Fort Worth because of adverse weather in the area. After 21:00, the first officer notified gate agents that flight 1420 would need to depart by 23:16 because of Americans company duty time limitation. Another aircraft was arranged and the flight departed at 22:40.  En route and Descent About 22:54, the flight dispatcher sent the flight crew an ACARS message indicating that the weather around Little Rock might be a factor during the arrival. The dispatcher suggested that the flight crew expedite the arrival to beat the thunderstorms if possible, and the flight crew acknowledged this message. About 23:04, the Fort Worth center broadcast an NWS Convective SIGMET [significant meteorological information] weather advisory for an area of severe thunderstorms that included the Little Rock airport area. The flight crew discussed the weather and the need to expedite the approach. At 23:25:47, the captain stated, ""we got to get over there quick."" About 5 seconds later, the first officer said, ""I dont like that...thats lightning,"" to which the captain replied, ""sure is."" The flight crew had the city of Little Rock and the airport area in sight by 23:26. Fort Worth center cleared the flight to descend to 10,000 feet msl. The flight was transferred to the Memphis ARTCC and at 23:34, the flight crew contacted the Little Rock Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). The controller advised the flight crew that a thunderstorm located northwest of the airport was moving through the area and that the wind was 280º at 28 knots gusting to 44 knots. The first officer told the controller that he and the captain could see the lightning. The controller told the flight crew to expect an ILS approach to runway 22L. At 23:36, the captain and first officer discussed American Airlines crosswind limitation for landing. The captain indicated that 30 knots was the crosswind limitation but realized that he had provided the limitation for a dry runway. The captain then stated that the wet runway crosswind limitation was 20 knots, but the first officer stated that the limitation was 25 knots. At 23:39:00, the controller cleared the flight to descend to an altitude of 3,000 feet msl. The controller then asked the flight crew about the weather conditions along the runway 22L final approach course, stating his belief that the airplanes weather radar was ""a lot better"" than the weather radar depiction available in the tower. At 23:39:12, the first officer stated, ""okay, we can...see the airport from here. We can barely make it out but we should be able to make [runway] two two...that storm is moving this way like your radar says it is but a little bit farther off than you thought."" The controller then offered flight 1420 a visual approach to the runway, but the first officer indicated, ""at this point, we really cant make it out. Were gonna have to stay with you as long as possible."" At 23:39:45, the controller notified flight 1420 of a windshear alert, reporting that the centerfield wind was 340º at 10 knots, the north boundary wind was 330º at 25 knots, and the northwest boundary wind was 010º at 15 knots. The flight crew then requested runway 04R so that there would be a headwind, rather than a tailwind, during landing. At 23:40:20, the controller instructed the flight crew to fly a heading of 250º for vectors to the runway 04R ILS final approach course. After reaching the assigned heading, the airplane was turned away from the airport and clear of the thunderstorm that had previously been reported by the controller. Between 23:40:46 and 23:41:31, the first officer stated the localizer frequency and course, the decision altitude, the minimum safe altitude, and a portion of the missed approach procedure for runway 04R. The captain then asked the first officer, ""do you have the airport? Is that it right there? I dont see a runway."" At 23:42:27, the controller told the flight crew that the second part of the thunderstorm was apparently moving through the area and that the winds were 340º at 16 knots gusting to 34 knots. At 23:42:40, the first officer asked the captain whether he wanted to accept ""a short approach"" and ""keep it in tight."" The captain answered, ""yeah, if you see the runway. cause I dont quite see it."" The first officer stated, ""yeah, its right here, see it?"" The captain replied, ""you just point me in the right direction and Ill start slowing down here."" At 23:42:55, the first officer said, ""its going right over the...field."" The first officer then told the controller, ""well we got the airport. Were going between clouds. I think its right off my, uh, three oclock low, about four miles."" The controller then offered a visual approach for runway 04R, and the first officer accepted. At 23:43:11, the controller cleared flight 1420 for a visual approach to runway 04R and indicated ""if you lose it, need some help, let me know please."" At 23:43:35, the first officer stated, ""youre comin in. Theres the airport."" Three seconds later, the captain stated, ""uh, I lost it,"" to which the first officer replied, ""see its right there."" The captain then stated, ""I still dont see it...just vector me. I dont know."" At 23:43:59, the controller cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the winds were 330º at 21 knots. At 23:44:19, the captain stated, ""see were losing it. I dont think we can maintain visual."" At 23:44:30, the first officer informed the controller that visual contact with the airport had been lost because of a cloud between the airplane and the airport. The controller then cleared the airplane to fly a heading of 220º for radar vectors for the ILS approach to runway 04R and directed the flight to descend to and maintain 2,300 feet msl. At 23:45:47, the first officer told the controller ""were getting pretty close to this storm. well keep it tight if we have to."" The controller indicated to the flight crew that, ""when you join the final, youre going to be right at just a little bit outside the marker if thats gonna be okay for ya."" The captain stated, ""thats great,"" and the first officer told the controller, ""thats great with us."" At 23:46:39, the controller advised the flight crew that the airplane was 3 miles from the outer marker. At 23:46:52, the captain stated, ""aw, were goin right into this."" At the same time, the controller reported that there was heavy rain at the airport, the ATIS information in effect at the time was no longer current, the visibility was less than 1 mile, and the runway visual range (RVR) for runway 04R was 3,000 feet. The first officer acknowledged this information.  Final approach At 23:47:08, the controller again cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the wind was 350º at 30 knots gusting to 45 knots. The first officer then read back the wind information as 030º at 45 knots. At 23:47:22, the captain stated, ""three thousand RVR. We cant land on that."" Four seconds later, the first officer indicated that the RVR for runway 04R was 2,400 feet, and the captain then said, ""okay, fine."" At 23:47:44, the captain stated, ""landing gear down."" About 5 seconds later, the captain stated, ""and lights please."" At 23:47:53, the controller issued a second windshear alert for the airport, reporting that the centerfield wind was 350º at 32 knots gusting to 45 knots, the north boundary wind was 310º at 29 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 32 knots. This transmission was not acknowledged by the flight crew. At 23:48:10, the captain stated, ""add twenty [knots],"" to which the first officer replied, ""right."" At 23:48:12, the controller reported that the runway 04R RVR was now 1,600 feet. About 23:48:18, the captain indicated that the flight was established on final approach; 6 seconds later, the first officer informed the controller that the flight was established on the inbound portion of the ILS. The controller repeated the clearance to land; stated that the wind was 340º at 31 knots, the north boundary wind was 300º at 26 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 25 knots; and repeated the RVR. At 23:48:41, the first officer acknowledged this information. The controller did not receive any further transmissions from flight 1420. At 23:49:02, the first officer asked the captain, ""want forty flaps?"" The captain indicated that he thought he had already called for the landing flaps, after which the first officer stated, ""forty now."" At 23:49:10, the controller informed the flight crew that the wind was 330º at 28 knots. Two seconds later, the captain stated, ""this is a can of worms."" The first officer stated, ""theres the runway off to your right, got it?"" at 23:49:24. The captain replied, ""no,"" to which the first officer stated, ""I got the runway in sight. Youre right on course. Stay where youre at."" The captain then stated, ""I got it. I got it."" At 23:49:32, the controller reported the wind to be 330º at 25 knots. At 23:49:53, the controller reported the wind to be 320º at 23 knots. From about 400 feet above field level (afl) the airplane drifted to the right. At 23:50:00, the first officer said, ""were way off."" The localizer deviation value was about one dot to the right at that point. About 1 second later, the captain stated, ""I cant see it."" About 3 seconds afterward, the first officer asked, ""got it?"" to which the captain replied, ""yeah I got it."" At 23:50:13 and :14, the GPWS radio altitude callout ""sink rate"" sounded.  Landing The airplane touched down on the runway about 23:50:20. About 23:50:22, the first officer stated ""were down;"" about 2 seconds later, he stated, ""were sliding."" Over a 7-second period after touchdown, both thrust reversers were deployed and the left and right engines engine pressure ratios (EPR) reached settings of 1.89 and 1.67, respectively. The thrust reversers were subsequently moved to the unlocked status (neither deployed nor stowed). The flight spoilers did not deploy symmetrically at touchdown. About the time that the brakes were applied, the thrust reversers were deployed again. At 23:50:32, the CVR recorded an unidentified voice in the cockpit stating ""on the brakes."" The left engine reached a maximum setting of 1.98 reverse EPR, and the right engine reached a setting of 1.64 reverse EPR. The left brake pedal was relaxed at 23:50:34 before returning to its full position 2 seconds later. About the time that the left brake pedal was relaxed, the reversers were returned to the unlocked status. As the right thrust reverser was being moved to the unlocked status, the right engine reached a maximum setting of 1.74 reverse EPR. At 23:50:36, a full aileron deflection was given. At 23:50:40, the left thrust reverser was moved back to the deployed position, but the right reverser moved briefly to the deployed position and then moved to the stowed position. According to FDR data, the left thrust reverser remained deployed, and the right thrust reverser remained stowed, for the remainder of the flight. After departing the end of the runway, the airplane struck several tubes extending outward from the left edge of the instrument landing system localizer array, located 411 feet beyond the end of the runway; passed through a chain link security fence; went down a rock embankment to a flood plain, located approximately 15 feet below the runway elevation; and collided with the structure supporting the runway 22L approach lighting system."
466,ACC1356,"The Thunder Airlines Beechcraft A100 King Air took off at 10:34 on a charter flight from Thunder Bay Airport, ON (YQT), for Red Lake Airport, ON (YRL), with two pilots and three passengers on board. After getting airborne, the aircraft pitched up to approximately 70 degrees, reaching a height estimated to be between 500 and 700 feet above ground level. It then rolled to the left, pitched steeply nose-down, and descended to the ground within the confines of the airport. The aircraft contacted the soft, level ground in a relatively level attitude and covered a distance of about 500 feet before coming to rest in a wooded area immediately beyond an elevated railroad bed and track. The cabin remained intact during the crash sequence, and all occupants escaped without any injuries. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. An ensuing fuel-fed fire was rapidly extinguished by airport emergency response services (ERS) personnel."
467,ACC1357,"During takeoff from Long Haul Lake, the engine failed. An engineer was flown in to troubleshoot the problem. Water was drained from the main fuel-filter and carburettor sumps. Two run-ups were conducted following which the pilot and engineer tried to take off. Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft's engine abruptly lost power. The pilot's attempts to restart the engine were unsuccessful, and the aircraft descended into a stand of trees and struck the ground."
468,ACC1358,"A Let 410 passenger plane, 5H-PAB, took off from Arusha Airport (ARK) at 12:35 hours for a circuit training. It was carrying one instructor, a pilot trainee and three passengers. The aircraft was flying VFR.The instructor said that he intended to execute nine touch and go circuit operations, three of which were to be performed with 42° flaps, another three with 18° flaps and the rest with zero degree flaps.The first six circuits were performed uneventfully. Before initiating the first flapless landing the instructor ordered the trainee to extend his approach and establish a six-mile final to runway 09. When the aircraft was established on the final for runway 09 the instructor saw that the aircraft was a bit too low and ordered the trainee to adjust his approach. After 5H-PAB was established on the approach slope the instructor advised the trainee to call when he needed props fully forward (setting propellers into full coarse pitch). This he subsequent1y did and the instructor, aware of the relatively high aircraft speed for the configuration advised the trainee to be careful on the flare in order to avoid the possibility of the tail skid hitting the ground. When the aircraft was flared, the tail skid hit and scraped the ground followed by the belly and the nose underside section. After sliding for 164 metres the aircraft came to rest on the runway with the engines still running. The instructor carried out the emergency shut down checks and evacuated the aircraft.It was only after touch down that the crew realised that they had belly landed. The commander then proceeded to select reverse thrust. There was no fire and none of the occupants was injured.The instructor said that he had forgotten to lower the landing gear because of his preoccupation with the rate of descent and the execution of the flapless flare. The pilot under instruction testified that he had concentrated too much an the technical side of flying to the point of forgetting to call for the gear down selection.There was only one checklist in use in the cockpit which was contained in a book and this was being used by the instructor. The instructor testified to have used the checklist for the first six landings. The checklist was not used for the accident landing. None pilot of the pilots reported to have heard the landing gear horn."
469,ACC1359,"The Ilyushin operated on a cargo flight from Moscow, Russia to Tianjin, China and return. On the return flight intermediate stops were planned at Irkutsk and Perm. During the stop at Irkutsk, 38000 kg of fuel was uplifted and the crew calculated the takeoff weight to be 170.040 kg, which was below the maximum takeoff weight for the given conditions of 174.000 kg. Takeoff speed was set at 235 km/h, which corresponded to a takeoff weight of 190.000 kg.On takeoff, the airplane barely gained height, reaching a speed of 250 km/h over the runway threshold. It pitched up to 16° with the airspeed decreasing. The flight engineer then put the no. 1 and no. 2 engines in reverse, causing the airplane to turn left. It missed and armed forces building and a transformer substation and crashed 1476 m from the end of the paved runway. A post-impact fire broke out.Two of the crewmembers received serious injuries (navigator's ribs were broken and aircraft technician got closed craniocerebral injury and had his crus broken) and the other five members got away with contusion and bruises.It was later established that the actual weight on takeoff was 198000 - 200000 kg, which was above the mtow. In Tianjin the cargo manifest indicated 49750 kg but onboard documents showed a total of 30040 kg."
470,ACC1360,"A McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10F, N68058, experienced separation of the left inboard trailing edge flap and flap vane while on final approach to land at the Memphis International Airport, Tennessee. The first officer was flying the airplane, and while executing a Category IIIB approach to runway 18L in VMC with the flaps fully extended, a loud ""jolt"" was heard. The autopilot was disconnected and the first officer reported having to use 1/2 to 3/4 right aileron input to counter the left banking tendency. He continued the approach and landed. firm with less ""controllability"", but the rollout was normal.Examination of the airplane by FAA personnel revealed that the left inboard trailing edge flap and vane separated from the airplane. The separated left inboard trailing edge flap and vane were found in a residential area approximately 4 miles north of the airport. The vane was noted to be missing an approximate 2-foot segment, which was found several days after the accident about 1 block from where the flap and vane were found. Further examination of the airplane revealed that the four bolts  of the forward attach point of the outboard hinge of the left inboard trailing edge flap, were failed."
471,ACC1361,"The airplane was flown to Bangor, ME (BGR) on August 11 for the installation of two auxiliary fuel tanks. The installation took place on August 12 and 13, and the pilot flew the airplane to Manchester, NH (MHT) where the auxiliary fuel tanks were filled. After takeoff from Manchester, as the airplane passed through about 800 to 900 feet, the pilot smelled turbine fuel. He stopped the climb and attempted to locate the source of the fumes. He could not identify the source of the fumes and requested radar vectors to the closest airport and initiated a descent. He then noticed about 1 inch of standing fuel on the floor of the cabin, and turned off the radios. During the descent, the amount of fuel in the cockpit area continued to increase, so the pilot elected to land in an open field rather than continue toward the airport. Due to fuel fumes and raw fuel in the cockpit, the pilot's vision was blurred, his eyes burned, and he had difficulty breathing. He positioned the airplane for landing into the wind. On final approach, the fuel was up over his ankles and his sectional charts were floating on top of the fuel. After touchdown, the airplane passed through a ditch. The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane nosed over. A post-crash fire destroyed the plane."
472,ACC1362,"A Canadair Challenger, N63HJ, ran off the side of the runway, collided with a taxiway sign, and collapsed the nose landing gear while landing on runway 8 at Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport, FL (FXE). Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The aircraft received substantial damage and the three crew members were not injured. The flight originated from Pueblo, Colorado, the same day, about 20:18.While enroute from Pueblo, Colorado, to Columbia, South Carolina, the captain's windshield delaminated, and the flight diverted to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for repairs. The first officer was flying the airplane and had been instructed by the captain to make a firm landing at Fort Lauderdale to get the airplanes weight on the wheels, due to the airplane being light. The landing was firm and the first officer activated the engine thrust reversers. As the nose landing gear touched down, the airplane began veering to the left. Attempts to control the veer to the left were unsuccessful and the airplane ran off the left side of the runway. The airplane then ran over a taxiway and collided with a taxiway sign and the concrete base for the sign. The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest. Examination of the runway showed alternating dark and light marks from the left main landing gear tire were present on the runway about 160 feet before marks from the right main landing gear tire are present. Post accident examination of the airplanes landing gear, tires, wheels, bakes, spoilers, and engine thrust reversers, showed no evidence of pre-accident failure or malfunction. At the time of the accident the flight crew had been on duty for about 17 hours 45 minutes."
473,ACC1363,"While on a training flight out of San Antonio, the instructor told the student to execute 'a no flap landing due to a simulated hydraulic pump failure.The student pilot maneuvered the airplane to intercept the ILS (instrument landing system) 12R approach, established the airplane on the approach and called for the ""Emergency Gear Extension Checklist."" The instructor stated that the landing gear could not be extended until landing was assured, but he forgot to lower the gear afterwards. The Metro III plane landed wheels up and slid off the side of the runway."
474,ACC1364,Crashed during maintenance test flight out of Santa Lucia Air Base. The airplane impacted the side of Cerro La Paila while flying in clouds at 2865 m.
475,ACC1365,"On 9 October 1999, a Fokker 100 aircraft, on a direct service from Brisbane with 84 persons on board, experienced severe vibration through the airframe during landing at Norfolk Island. The crew stopped the aircraft on the runway and, after a preliminary examination, taxied the aircraft to the terminal where the passengers disembarked normally. There were no injuries. Investigation revealed that the left main landing gear upper torque link attachment lugs had broken. The upper torque link attachment point on the landing gear main fitting was an integrally forged double lug with a stiffening web between the two lugs. The maintenance documentation showed that the main landing gear had completed 16,579 cycles since new and 658 cycles since last overhaul. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) conducted specialist fracture analysis of all the broken landing gear components. The specialist report concluded that the failure of the torque link attachment lugs was associated with the extension of pre-existing cracking in the lug-stiffening web while torque was transmitting through the torque links. The initial cracking in the web was caused by stress corrosion. The propagation of the fatigue crack was consistent with a loading regime that involved the sideways flexing of the wheel rim. This will occur when a turning moment (torque) is applied to the main landing gear while the wheels are rotating, such as during ground turning or cross-wind landings. The evidence showed that the region of the pivot pin bore and locating pinhole had been reworked during overhaul. At that time material had been removed by localised surface grinding to remove corrosion. The pivot bore surface was then shot peened and repainted with a chromate based paint primer. However, the paint primer exhibited poor adhesion and the shot peening coverage was haphazard. Consequently, these measures had been ineffective in preventing stress corrosion. The final failure of the torque link attachment lugs occurred during the initial stage of the landing, and occurred while the landing gear was being subjected to significant torque loads. It is likely that the torque loads were associated with cross-wind conditions. The crew report for a previous landing incident with this aircraft at Norfolk Island, indicated that cross-wind components of 15 knots or higher are regularly experienced during operations at Norfolk Island. The operator's maintenance facility reported that part of the left main gear shimmy damper was found to have been wrongly re-assembled during last overhaul. The fracture analysis evidence indicates this would have had minimal if any influence on the start or development of the fatigue cracks that led to the failure of the torque link attachment lugs. A previous incident occurred on 4 July 1999, involving the left main landing gear of this aircraft, also while landing at Norfolk Island. In that incident, the outboard main landing gear wheel broke away from the wheel hub during the landing roll. The ATSB specialist fracture analysis report (see below) found the wheel failure had started and progressed in similar circumstances to those for the torque link attachment lugs."
476,ACC1366,"While holding outside the control zone at Red Lake (YRL) pending a special VFR clearance, the pilot made a descending turn to avoid a flock of large birds. The right wing struck the water of Ranger Lake and the Cessna overturned.A military DHC-8 diverted to Red Lake and located the Cessna on the west side of Ranger Lake. The airplane was partially submerged and the pilot was on the wing. A floatplane (C-FVTU) subsequently picked up the pilot and returned him to Red Lake. The pilot suffered shoulder injuries, arm injuries, facial injuries and hypothermia."
477,ACC1367,"A man claimed to have explosives in a bag and threatened to blow up the plane if the pilot refused to divert the flight to Taiwan. The pilot initially requested permission to land in Taiwan, but crew members overpowered the hijacker and found that his bag only contained sugar. The airplane turned away and landed in Xiamen (XMN)."
478,ACC1368,"While departing Bethel (BET) runway 36, about 100 feet (30 m) above the runway, the pilot retracted the flaps to he 10 degrees position. As the airplane climbed to about 200 feet (60 m) above the runway, he retracted the remaining 10 degrees of flaps, and the airplane began to descend. The pilot said full power was already applied to the engine, but the airplane continued to descend. The airplane landed on the runway, about 200 feet from the runway threshold, and continued off the end of the runway, into soft, snow-covered terrain. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the propeller, fuselage, and wings."

480,ACC1370,"The crew of C-GKBN, a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air with 5 passengers, made a straight-in approach, with approach flap settings, to a snow-covered and icy runway at Hamburg, AB, Canada. Upon touchdown in 2 inches of snow, directional control was lost. The aircraft turned sideways on the strip, struck a snow windrow, which then pulled the aircraft off the strip into a stand of trees. The First Officer had made the landing. The aircraft had picked up about 1/8 inch of ICA on the approach. Approach flap had been used for the landing instead of landing flap. The aircraft had landed with a five knot tail wind. The landing touchdown was reported to be very firm. There were no injuries but the aircraft was substantially damaged. Company representatives examining the runway surface after the accident discovered a rut running diagonally across the runway, which was apparently present prior the landing and may have contributed to the loss of directional control of the aircraft."

After takeoff the captain forgot to retract the gear (the floats-equipped Caravan has wheels installed on the floats) The flight to Filitheyo was conducted at FL45. On approaching Filitheyo Seaplane Base, the captain realized that the GPS position fed to the system was that of the resort island (Filitheyo), not the GPS position of the landing site near Filitheyo resort (Dhiguvaru Falhu) which is about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of Filitheyo. The captain, until he was about to land was busy in correcting the GPS co-ordinates for the landing site. On landing on water the aircraft sprung back and the captain realized that the landing gear was down. The aircraft bounced back and flipped onto its back pivoting the nose and left wing."

4,ACC1375,"A McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30F, N302FE, operated by Federal Express, was substantially damaged during pushback at Newark International Airport (EWR), New Jersey. The airplane was taxiing to the runway for departure when the APU door light illuminated. The airplane returned to the loading dock, the engines were shut down, the APU door was closed, and the APU was secured. The airplane's engines were then restarted at the dock, and the airplane began another pushback. During that pushback, it contacted the loading dock, and suffered an 8-foot gash along the left side, below the cockpit area."
5,ACC1376,"On the day of the accident, the Embraer Bandeirante aircraft was engaged in a charter operation for the Central Bank of Nigeria. The first segment of the flight from Lagos (LOS) to Abuja (ABV) was flown by the Commander. The aircraft departed Lagos about 06:30 hours UTC and initially at cruise, the crew had a momentary problem setting power on the starboard engine after which the flight continued normally to Abuja. The aircraft which departed Abuja for Jos (JOS) at 09:00 hours UTC first officer at the controls. At FL 90 and about 30NM from Abuja, the crew again had problems with the cruise power setting on the starboard engine. The torque remained at 1400. The crew retarded the right power lever to the minimum with the aim of achieving a cruise setting of 1300 but the gear warning came on. The Commander at this stage took over the controls from the first officer. At 09:23 hours UTC, the aircraft contacted Kaduna Tower that it would be diverting to Kaduna (KAD) giving its flight level as 90 at a distance of 61 miles and estimating TMA at 24 miles, 'KC' at 41 miles, 6 souls on board and 5 hours endurance at departure. The tower then gave the aircraft an inbound clearance to 'KC' locator maintaining FL 90 and to expect no delay for a locator approach runway 05. Weather report at 09:00 hours UTC was also passed to the aircraft as wind 090/05 knots, QNH 1014 and temperature 30°C. At 09:28 hours UTC the airplane at about 42 miles, speed between 150-160 kts, requested descent and was cleared to 4,500ft, QNH 1014. At about 09:35 hours UTC, the pilots contacted tower that they would make a single engine approach because they were having problems controlling power on the starboard engine and it would be shut down. The commander then reviewed the single engine approach with the first officer estimating 4,500 ft at 8NM. Approaching 4,500 ft at 11 NM, the crew initiated right engine shut down after which the speed was decayed from 150 to 140 kts. At 09:46 hours UTC, the pilot reported 6nm final and field in sight while the tower requested him to report 4 miles final. The controller reported having the aircraft in sight and subsequently cleared it to land on runway 05 giving wind as north easterly 06 knots. Descending at 500ft/min, the commander requested for 25% of flap when the first officer selected full flap. When the aircraft was at 2,700 ft high, the speed had already decayed to between 100 - 110 kts. The crew applied full power on the port engine to arrest the speed decay but to no avail. The pilot was trying to correct the descent rate, speed decay and the asymmetry when the stall warning came on. The aircraft belly landed and struck the new VOR/DME site being constructed about 1175 m from the threshold of runway 05."
6,ACC1377,"The DC-3 was chartered to transport building materials to Ennadai Lake and was on the second flight of the day. The ice strip on the lake was 2700 feet approximate in length, 150 feet wide. The aircraft was observed to touch down nearly halfway along the ice strip, the tail of the aircraft remained in the air, and the aircraft took off almost immediately. The main landing gear was seen to retract. The aircraft reached the end of the runway then abruptly entered a steep, nose-up attitude, banked sharply to the left, turned left, and descended into the ice. The left wing made first contact with the ice. The aircraft rotated around the left wing and struck the ice in a steep, nose-down attitude about 400 feet from the end of the ice strip."
7,ACC1378,"The captain was the flying pilot for the night landing on runway 01 in IMC, with a right cross wind from 110 degrees at 14 gusting 18 knots, drizzle, and a wet runway. Prior to starting the approach, the flightcrew determined that the landing approach speed (Vref) and the approach speed (Vapp) were 122 and 128 knots, respectively. The airplane flying on autopilot passed the middle marker at 200 feet AGL at 130 knots on the ILS approach. Approximately 3 seconds after the first officer called ""runway in sight twelve o'clock,"" the captain disconnected the autopilot, while at a radio altitude of 132 feet and on a heading of approximately 18 degrees. Within approximately 11 seconds after the autopilot disconnect, the glideslope and localizer deviation increased. The first officer called ""runway over there."" Approximately 5 seconds before touchdown, the airplane rolled right, then left, then right. The airplane crossed the threshold at an altitude of 35 feet and 130 knots and touched down 2,802 feet from the approach end of the 5,495-foot runway (844-foot displaced threshold) at 125 knots. The Saab 340 overran the runway and struck a ditch 175 feet beyond the departure end of the runway. The aircraft was reportedly considered damaged beyond repair and used for spares."

12,ACC1383,"A man brandished a jar of hair gel and claimed it to be a bomb on board EgyptAir flight 233. The hijacker told the chief flight attendant that he wanted to go to Afghanistan so that he could find a job. After making the demand, the hijacker attempted to storm the cockpit of the Airbus A321 aircraft but was unable to gain entry and was overpowered by crew members. The plane landed in Aswan where the hijacker was taken into custody and charged with air piracy and threatening the lives of airplane passengers. None of the 19 people on the flight were injured."
13,ACC1384,The local Gabonese Power Supply Company (S.E.E.G.) chartered a Beechcraft 1900 plane from the Avirex company for a flight from Libreville to Moanda.Last contact with the flight was when the flight was cleared to 4100 feet. The aircraft was later found to have crashed on approach to runway 14; weather included fog and mist.
14,ACC1385,"The Swearingen SA226TC, N235BA, aborted takeoff at Denver International Airport, Colorado, USA, when the number two engine shed a propeller blade. The aircraft sustained substantial damage and the pilot and sole occupant received minor injuries. The flight was cleared for takeoff on runway 35L. The pilot said he advanced the speed levers to high and brought the power levers to 800 foot-pounds of torque. As he was about to release the brakes to begin takeoff roll he felt an impact and noise like something hit the aircraft on the right side. He looked over at the right engine and observed it to be in a ""severe state of vibration"". He secured the right engine, declared an emergency to the tower, and then secured the left engine. Following ""spool down"" the pilot exited the aircraft and observed that the right engine had shed a propeller blade about 10 inches outboard from the hub."
15,ACC1386,"The aircraft was engaged in dropping skydivers out of Leopoldsburg Airport. The flight took off from runway 26 at 18:55, intending to drop 14 skydivers on static line jump from 3.400 ft altitude.After the drop of the first stick of 4 skydivers, the pilot slightly increased power to perform a normal pattern bringing him back above the field in order to drop the second stick. At that moment, he heard a loud bang and felt a yaw movement to the left. Looking outside to the left, he noticed that the no.1 engine was on fire. He initiated a forced landing procedure to the airfield during which the rest of the parachutists successfully bailed out. At some stage during the procedure, the engine mount failed and the engine took an angle of approximately 90° down. The pilot could not reach the runway and made a forced landing.The aircraft was stored at Kortrijk/Wevelgem Airport and was repaired by 2004."
16,ACC1387,"A McDonnell Douglas DC-9-51, N649HA, operated by Hawaiian Airlines as flight number 193, made a hard landing, striking its tail, on runway 35 at the Lihue Airport, Hawaii, USA. The airplane was substantially damaged. Two passengers received minor injuries. On the accident flight the first officer was at the controls. The flight departed from Honolulu about 40 minutes behind schedule. Approaching the airport, the captain received an air traffic control clearance to perform a VOR/DME runway 35 instrument approach. At 17:04:31, the crew reported having the field in sight, and at 17:05:48, the airplane was cleared to land. The final approach segment was commenced with stabilized engine thrust and with a stabilized rate of descent. The approach terminated in a higher-than-normal deck angle, and an abnormally high rate of sink from 50 feet above ground level to touchdown. The resulting hard landing caused portions of the aft fuselage to come in contact with the runway.The captain felt that the landing was firmer than routine but he did not consider it to have been a ""hard landing."" A flight attendant was ""alarmed by the loud sound of metal impacting the ground."" Several oxygen compartments opened resulting in oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling. The flight attendant then disembarked from the tailcone stairway exit. Upon looking at the outside airplane structure, the attendant ""noticed the safety skid plate device (was) badly scraped and around the panel, liquid (was) dripping.""In preparation for their next flight, the captain performed a walk around visual inspection of the airplane. The captain reported that the ""tail bumper compression indicator was safety wired and in its normal position."" Thereafter, passengers boarded the airplane and they flew to Honolulu. There the aircraft was inspected by maintenance"
17,ACC1388,"Wuhan Airlines flight 343 departed Enshi for a flight to Wuhan. The aircraft entered an area of poor weather; rain and thunderstorm with associated windshear. The crew reportedly circled Wuhan for about 30 minutes to wait for the storm to pass. Wuhan's weather bureau recorded 451 thunderclaps in a 10-minute period as the plane circled. During the approach the first officer proposed to land at an alternate airport, but the captain decided to continue to Wuhan.The plane was caught by windshear and crashed near Sitai Village, Yongfeng Township. Half of the plane plunged into a farmhouse and the other half came to rest on a dike of the Han River. Sitai is located about 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 18 miles) from Wuhan. Seven workers who were installing generators on a vessel were killed when the plane hit.The Yun-7 airliner had recorded 13,811 safe flight hours and completed 11,724 takeoffs and landings by the end of May, finishing two-thirds of its lifespan."
18,ACC1389,"The pilot and owner of float equipped DHC-6 Twin Otter C-FWAH (and founder of Wardair) flew from Edmonton/Cooking Lake to the Yellowknife Water Aerodrome. There were three passengers and about 700 pounds of supplies on board. Upon arrival at Yellowknife, the pilot selected full fine pitch on the propellers, then selected 20 degrees of flap for the cross wind landing, to the north, at the Back Bay. Upon touchdown, the aircraft porpoised, bounced back into the air, then porpoised again and bounced back into the air. On the third bounce, the left wing dropped, the left float dug into the water and the aircraft swerved to the left. The right wing then dug into the water and became detached from the aircraft. The aircraft came to a stop resting on its damaged floats. The four occupants vacated the substantially damaged aircraft and were rescued, within minutes, by a nearby power boat operator. There were no injuries. The wind was from 100 degrees true at 13 knots and visibility was 15 statute miles."

20,ACC1391,"The aircraft departed Bajhang at 10:11 for a 30-minute flight to Dhangadhi. Last radio contact was at 10:31. The aircraft was found to have collided with pine trees on the 4300 feet Jarayakhali hill on the Churia mountain range, also known as Sivalik Hills, before catching fire."
21,ACC1392,"The float-equipped Cessna Caravan had dropped of some RCMP Emergency Response Team (ERT) members at Teslin Lake. The aircraft was maneuvered for takeoff when it suddenly grounded on a gravel bar. The ERT members, working with the aircrafts maintenance engineer who had been called in, eventually managed to free the aircraft. They had been working for nearly seven hours to free the plane. At 23:50, after the engineer had pumped the floats, the pilot started the aircraft and taxied down the lake for a short distance before returning to start the takeoff run. The pilot took off downwind and passed over an RCMP boat at about 100 feet, then entered a steep climb. At the top of the climb, it stalled and yawed to the left. The aircraft descended and struck the water in a near-vertical attitude. The wreckage sank to a depth of 66 feet (20 m)."
22,ACC1393,"The aircraft was conducting a normal approach to runway 12 at Bahrain International Airport with auto-pilot/flight director disconnected upon visual contact with the runway. Approximately 1nm from touchdown, at about 600 feet amsl and at an airspeed of 185 mph the crew requested a left-hand orbit (360 degree turn) because they were too high and fast on the approach. During the tight (36degree bank angle) left hand turn the flaps were fully extended and the landing checklist completed. When the aircraft crossed the extended runway centerline the crew reported they wanted to abort the landing. A controller gave the crew clearance to climb to 2,500 feet at a 300-degree heading to prepare for another approach. The plane's speed began increasing to 185 knots as it began to climb to 1000 feet in a 5-degree nose-up attitude. During the go-around at approximately 1,000 feet, the aircraft entered a rapid descent, 15-degrees nose down. As the GPWS sounded, the captain ordered the flaps to be raised and moved the sidestick aft. The Airbus impacted the sea at a 6.5-degreee nose down angle, north of the airport. The plane's last recorded airspeed was about 280 knots.Two very remarkable accidents happened June 1950 within a period of just 3 days. On June 12 an Air France DC-4 descended into the sea while on a night-time approach to Bahrain. Two days later, another Air France DC-4 descended into the sea off Bahrain, also on a night-time approach."
23,ACC1394,"A Beechcraft 200 Super King Air, VH-SKC, departed Perth Airport, WA (PER) at 10:09 UTC on a charter flight to Leonora Airport, WA (LNO) with one pilot and seven passengers on board. Until 10:32 the operation of the aircraft and the communications with the pilot appeared normal. However, shortly after the aircraft had climbed through its assigned altitude, the pilot's speech became significantly impaired and he appeared unable to respond to ATS instructions. Open microphone transmissions over the next 8-minutes revealed the progressive deterioration of the pilot towards unconsciousness and the absence of any sounds of passenger activity in the aircraft. No human response of any kind was detected for the remainder of the flight. Five hours after taking off from Perth, the aircraft impacted the ground near Burketown, Queensland, and was destroyed. There were no survivors.The aircraft's flightpath was consistent with the aircraft being controlled by the autopilot with no human intervention after the aircraft passed position DEBRA. After the aircraft climbed above the assigned altitude of FL250, the speech and breathing patterns of the pilot displayed changes that were consistent with hypoxia, but a rapid or explosive aircraft cabin depressurisation was unlikely to have occurred.Testing revealed that Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen Cyanide were highly unlikely to have been factors in the occurrence, and the absence of irritation in the airways of the occupants indicated that a fire in the cabin was also unlikely. The possibility of the pilot alone being incapacitated by a medical condition such as a stroke or heart attack would appear unlikely, given that there was no apparent activity or action by the other occupants of the aircraft for the duration of the flight.The investigation concluded that while there are several possible reasons for the pilot and passengers being incapacitated, the incapacitation was probably a result of hypobaric hypoxia due to the aircraft being fully or partially unpressurised and their not receiving supplemental oxygen. Due to the extensive nature of the damage to the aircraft caused by the impact with the ground, and because no recording systems were installed in the aircraft (nor were they required to be), the investigation could not determine the reason for the aircraft being unpressurised, or why the pilot and passengers did not receive supplemental oxygen."

Reports we received from residents said that the plane flew over the city at an altitude of barely 65 meters, with smoke billowing from the aircraft.An emergency belly landing was carried out at the Hamani Diori International Airport. A fire erupted and destroyed the plane. A short circuit is said to have caused the fire."
25,ACC1396,"The pilot was performing a GPS runway 14 approach to Greenville, and descended below the minimum descent altitude when he believed he had the runway environment in sight. When the pilot realized he was not near the runway, he added full power and attempted to climb; however, the airplane struck rising terrain about 2 miles northwest of the airport. The airport was located at an elevation of 1,400 feet, and the airplane impacted terrain at an elevation of approximately 1,200 feet. According to the GPS runway 14 approach procedure, the minimum descent altitude was 2,300 feet."
26,ACC1397,"The flight was chartered by a local engineering company to transport equipment to Kugluktuk and return with empty fuel barrels. On the return trip, the pilot was to overfly and inspect the abandoned airstrip at Port Radium on Great Bear Lake, from which he planned to operate in the next few days. The flight arrived in Kugluktuk at 13:18, unloaded the cargo, loaded empty fuel barrels, and refuelled. The flight departed Kugluktuk at 14:24 for Port Radium. Using GPS navigation the pilots flew to Port Radium and initiated a descent for the airstrip. The plane descended until it hit treetops. The wings were torn off the fuselage and the fuselage contacted up-sloping rocky terrain. The aircraft bounced and tumbled up the 12-degree slope and came to rest at the top of a steep slope of snow and ice, inverted."

The hijackers apparently were part of a group of four families demanding to be flown to the United States. The hijacking was foiled by members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which is responsible for security on Iranian flights. During the ensuing struggle, one IRGC member was shot and a second stabbed. A flight attendant and five hijackers were also injured. The plane landed safely at Bandar Abbas Airport, and the hijacking ended when the pilots escaped from the cockpit. The hijackers and their families, a total of 23 people, were placed under arrest."
28,ACC1399,"Dirgantara Flight 3130 was a scheduled flight from Datah Dawai to Samarinda. According to the passenger and load manifest the airplane carried 12 passengers. In fact however, 17 passengers were on the flight. Two of the five additional passengers paid the pilot ten times the actual ticket price and were allowed to board the plane. This was common practice. The Islander was now 272 lb (123 kg) over the maximum takeoff weight. After takeoff from runway 02 the aircraft gained insufficient height. The undercarriage contacted trees on three occasions until the airplane crashed into the trees, 2 kilometers past the runway."
29,ACC1400,"At 05:43 hours in the morning the Corvette jet departed Málaga on a short flight to Córdoba where the crew were to pick up personnel for a medical (transplantation) flight. Weather at Córdoba was not very good with a horizontal visibility of 300 meters and 500 ft vertically. The airport did not have an ILS runway so the captain decided to carry out an approach using the on board GPS. During the approach to runway 21, the airplane collided with an electricity pole, contacted the ground, and hit an unoccupied building."
30,ACC1401,"The accident followed an uneventful flight of returning holiday-makers, from Lanzarote, Spain, to Shannon, with the landing carried out on runway 24. Weather conditions in the approach and landing area showed rain, strong winds and associated turbulence. On landing, the aircrafts nose wheel assembly collapsed rearwards.  The aircraft continued along most of the length of runway 24 on its nose, finally coming to a halt beyond taxiway Alpha. An evacuation was carried out."

The wreckage was found the next day at 2,800 feet on a steep ridge line about 10 miles southeast of Redoubt Volcano. The same aircraft, N1419Z (also piloted by captain Munsoon) was involved in a fuel spill incident at Kenai, August 31, 2000. The C-46 Commando had just loaded 450 gallons of aviation fuel into its primary tank when Kenai Airport Fuel Service crews heard a loud popping noise and saw fuel leaking from the tank. The spill was quickly contained thanks to prompt action by the fueling crew, Everts Air employees and the fire services."
34,ACC1405,"A Beechcraft B200 Super King Air, N30EM, impacted Beaver Mountain, south of the Rangeley Municipal Airport, Maine. The certificated commercial pilot and passenger were fatally injured. A mixture of night instrument meteorological and visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight that departed Portland, Maine, destined for Rangeley.When the airplane was 17 miles southwest of its destination, the pilot was cleared for an instrument approach. At 9 miles, the pilot reported the airport in sight, and cancelled his IFR clearance. The airplane continued to descend towards the airport on a modified left base until radar contact was lost at 3,300 feet msl. The pilot was in radio contact with his wife just prior to the accident. He advised her that he was on base for runway 32. Neither the pilot's wife, nor ATC received a distress call from the pilot. The airplane was located the next morning about 100 feet below the top of a mountain. The accident site was 7.9 miles from the airport, and approximately 1,200 feet above the airport elevation. Ground based weather radar recorded light snow showers, in the general vicinity of the accident site about the time of the accident, and satellite imagery showed that the airplane was operating under a solid overcast. A level path was cut through the trees that preceded the main wreckage. Examination of both engines and the airframe revealed no pre impact failures or malfunctions."
35,ACC1406,"The aircraft, with the pilot and four passengers on board, departed Blackbushe from runway 08 in fog with a visibility of less than 500 metres. As the aircraft reached the upwind end of the runway it was seen to bank to the left before disappearing from view. It crashed 13 seconds later into a factory complex where a major fire ensued. All on board were fatally injured. A substantial amount of the aircraft structure was consumed by fire. Engineering examination of that which remained showed that there was no malfunction found within the engines, propellers or controls that would have affected the flight. Analysis of the cockpit voice recorder however showed a reduction in one of the propellers rpm as the aircraft rotated that would have led to thrust asymmetry. Through a combination of lack of visual reference, confusion as to the cause of the power reduction and possible disorientation the pilot lost control of the aircraft and although he may have realised the situation seconds before impact with the ground there was insufficient height available to effect a safe recovery."

During the flight they were informed that it had reduced to five kilometers. When they reached Maiduguri, however, visibility was around just 150 m, due to a dust storm. The aircraft crash-landed near the airport while on approach to runway 05. Nigerian Aviation Safety Initiative (NASI) officials said that irregular power supply and control of air field lighting may have been contributory factors to the crash.The operator is also been quoted as ""Air Eagle""."

40,ACC1411,After takeoff from Omsk engine problems forced the crew of this Antonov An-70 to perform an emergency landing in the snow. The aircraft crash-landed and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. The aircraft was on its way to Yakutsk for the final tests of the plane in low temperature conditions.
41,ACC1412,"The aircraft departed Fairbanks around 11:30 to deliver about 4,800 gallons of fuel oil to the remote mining site 12 miles north of Crooked Creek, AK. The 5,400 feet long by 100 feet wide airstrip is situated within hilly, snow-covered terrain and has a 7 percent uphill grade. Flat light conditions existed at the airstrip, and light snow showers were present, with visibility reported at 2 miles. The captain stated that during final approach, as the airplane passed over the airstrip threshold, flat light conditions made it very difficult to discern where the airstrip surface was. He said that the initial touch down was ""firm"", but was thought to be within acceptable tolerances. Just after touchdown, the left wing broke free from the airplane at the wing to fuselage attach point. The airplane veered to the left, and off the left side of the runway."
42,ACC1413,"The Caravelle was operating on a cargo flight from Bogotá to Mitú via El Yopal. The cargo consisted of a.o. 14 barrels with 55 gallons of gasoline each. The aircraft departed El Yopal at 13:45. While attempting to land at Mitú, the landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold of runway 01. The crew carried out a go around and assessed the situation. The left hand main gear was broken away and a hydraulic leak caused control problems. By switching from the yellow to the blue hydraulic system, the crew were able to regain control.After flying over the control tower at Mitú, they were informed by the controller of the loss of the left main left gear. The flight crew then declared an emergency and informed the tower controller at Mitú that they would proceed to Bogotá. The crew was not able to fully raise the flaps, so a decision was made to divert to El Yopal/The plane climbed to 10000 feet and proceeded to El Yopal at this altitude. The crew then observed that the left engine oil pressure was dropping and the pilot proceeded to shut down the engine. In these conditions the plane began to lose height and speed. They then established contact with the control tower of El Yopal, informing the them of the emergency. It was decided to perform another flyby of the tower, which confirmed the left main hear had separated.The crew then agreed to burn fuel from the left wing tank to avoid a fire on that side during the emergency landing. The fuel indicators showed unreliable values and calculations were difficult since last part of the flight was performed under irregular circumstances. It was then decided to select the left fuel tank and continue to burn fuel until the low fuel warning appeared.The co-pilot recommended the captain to try to restart the left engine to have both reversers available on landing, but the request was rejected.Flying to the South-West of El Yopal Airport, the pilot ordered the co-pilot to move further away from the runway, while taking his cell phone to communicate with the Director of Operations of the airline. When the low fuel alarm went off, they selected the right tank, and the captain decided to return to land. During the approach the right engine began to fail. The plane lost height quickly until it impacted the ground 4.9 miles from the threshold of runway 05. The aircraft caught fire after the impact and was completely destroyed."
43,ACC1414,Crashed and burst into flames on landing. The UNITA claimed responsibility and said all 22 on board were killed in the accident. Officials sources deny these claims and say the Antonov skidded off the runway following engine problems and stated that 10 occupants were injured.
44,ACC1415,"Shorts 360 EI-BPD departed Dublin at 18:14 for a flight to Sheffield. The aircraft was cleared for the ILS/DME procedure for runway 28 and the crew requested the QFE which was 980 hPa. The decision height for the approach was 400 feet. At 1918:11 the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. When the aircraft intercepted the glidepath, the flaps were set to 15° correctly configuring the aircraft for the approach. The handling pilot recalled that initially the rate of descent was slightly higher than the expected 650 ft/min leading him to suspect the presence of a tailwind, however, the rate of descent returned to a more normal value when approximately 4 nm from the runway. The propellers were set to the maximum rpm at 1,200 feet agl. When the crew reported that they were inside 4 nm they were cleared to land and passed the surface wind, which was variable at 2 kt; they were also warned that the runway surface was wet. Both pilots saw the runway lights when approaching 400 feet agl; the flaps were selected to 30° and confirmed at that position. Both pilots believed that the airspeed was satisfactory but, as the commander checked back on the control column for the landing, the rate of descent increased noticeably and the aircraft landed firmly. Both pilots believed that the power levers were in the flight idle position and neither was aware of any unusual control inputs during the landing flare. The aircraft bounced before hitting the ground again, this time with the nose wheel first, before bouncing once more. The aircraft was then seen to travel about half way along the runway before slewing to the left and running onto the grass. When the aircraft stopped the left wing tip appeared to be touching the grass."
45,ACC1416,"Crashed and burst into flames in a farm field in heavy rain. All of the passengers were members of a Virginia-based military construction and engineering crew on a routine training mission. The plane's pilot and two other crew members were members of the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National GuardIt appeared that the pilot's decision to go to the bathroom shifted the weight of the already unbalanced plane and caused it to become unstable and uncontrollable while in an area of strong turbulence. The nose of the plane slowly pitched up and then abruptly dropped just before the crash. In three seconds, the plane rose more than 100 feet with its nose down, and was then rocked by wind shear three times greater than what is defined as extreme turbulence. Within the first 12 seconds that they encountered problems, the G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight. It was also established that the weather radar was underpowered, negatively impacting the ability of the crew to successfully circumnavigate around the severe weather.This C-23B Sherpa was originally built as a Shorts 360 (SH-3684) in December 1985 and was delivered to Simmons Airlines as N374MQ In 1998 the aircraft was converted to a Sherpa C-23B+."
46,ACC1417,"The aircraft was 46 minutes into a scheduled flight from Nassau, Bahamas, to Orlando, Florida. The airplane was being controlled by the autopilot at about 18,000 feet when they encountered instrument meteorological conditions that rapidly led to the windscreen being covered by a layer of ice. The crew turned ice protection systems on and the ice on the windshield was cleared. The first officer observed ice on the right wing's boots and the right prop's spinner that extended farther back than he had previously experienced. The first officer then switched the ice protection systems to their highest settings. De airspeed then decreased from 1750 to 160 kts. The captain disconnected the autopilot, applied power, and initiated nose down pitch inputs to arrest the airspeed loss. They indicated that these actions were unsuccessful and the speed further deteriorated to about 130 knots at which point the airplane rolled about 90 degrees to the left, and then back to near level. In the next 24 seconds, the airplane again rolled about 110 degrees to the left, back to level, then about 120 degrees to the right, back to level, and then rolled 360 degrees to the right, back to near wings level. Since the crew reported trouble with the flight attitude instruments, the roll angles recorded on the FDR are being further investigated. The maximum nose down pitch attitude was 60 degrees, the maximum recorded airspeed was about 240 kias, and maximum vertical acceleration during recovery was about +3.6 g. The crew immediately diverted to West Palm Beach and landed there 12 minutes after the upset."

48,ACC1419,An Antonov 32 cargo plane suffered an engine overspeed en route between Luanda Airport (LAD) and Cafunfo Airport (CFF) in Angola. Eventually the propeller of the engine broke away. The crew declared an emergency and diverted to Malange Airport (MEG). A safe landing was carried out.
49,ACC1420,"At 23:20, 3 April 2001, the Royal Cargo flight Montreal-Mirabel for a scheduled IFR cargo flight to Hamilton, Montreal-Mirabel, Halifax, St. John's and back to Mirabel again. At 05:45, the aircraft departed Halifax for St. John's. The pilot flying was completing his line indoctrination training after having recently upgraded to captain. En route the crew were advised of a NOTAM that the ILS for runway 11 was unserviceable. Because of the marginal weather, the loss of runway 11/29, and his greater experience, the training captain decided to switch seats and assume the duties and full responsibilities as captain and pilot flying.Clearance for an ILS approach to runway 16 was obtained from Gander ACC, and the crew was advised to contact St. John's tower. Just over two minutes before landing, the tower advised that the wind was 050° (estimated) at 20, gusting to 35, knots. The aircraft crossed the final approach fix on the ILS glideslope at 150 KIAS. During the final approach, the airspeed steadily increased to 180 KIAS (ground speed 190 knots); the glidepath was maintained with a descent rate of 1000 feet per minute. From 1000 feet above sea level, no airspeed calls were made; altitude calls were made and responses were made. The Royal Boeing 737 operations manual states that the PNF shall call out significant deviations from programmed airspeed. In the descent, through 900 feet above sea level, the aircraft encountered turbulence resulting in uncommanded roll and pitch deviations and airspeed fluctuations of ±11 knots. At about 300 feet above decision height, the crew acquired visual references for landing. They were cleared to land. The aircraft touched down at 164 KIAS (27 KIAS above the desired touchdown speed of Vref), 2300 to 2500 feet beyond the threshold. The wind at this point was determined to be about 050° at 30 knots. Shortly after touchdown, the speed brakes and thrust reversers were deployed. With approximately 1100 feet of runway remaining, through a speed of 64 KIAS, reverse thrust increased to about 1.97 EPR on engine 1 and 2.15 EPR on engine 2. As the aircraft approached the end of the runway, the captain attempted to steer the aircraft to the right, toward the Delta taxiway intersection. Twenty-two seconds after touchdown, the aircraft exited the departure end of the runway into deep snow. The aircraft came to rest approximately 75 feet beyond and 53 feet to the right of the runway centreline.The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. The aircraft sustained serious damage to the landing gear and the left engine detached from the wing.Royal Airlines was acquired by Canada 3000 later that year.

50,ACC1421,"C-FWPN, a Beechcraft 100 King Air with 5 people on board, was landing on runway 29 at Grande Prairie Airport, AB (YQU) after a flight from Fort St. John Airport, BC (YXJ), when it struck a windrow of snow left beside the runway. It was reported that the aircraft touched down off the centre-line in two inches of snow and skidded off the runway surface. There was substantial damage to the aircraft's nose gear, nose cone and propellers. The runway surface was in the process of being plowed but was slippery with 2 foot high windrows on the sides."
51,ACC1422,"Soon after it taking off, one of the engines caught fire and the crew carried out a forced landing on a beach, 6 km from the runway. The aircraft caught fire and burned out."
52,ACC1423,"During landing at the end of the preceding flight, the aircraft overran the runway and struck an obstacle, damaging the propeller. In spite of this, the pilot, who was on an urgent medical mission, decided to take off. Thrust was inadequate, making it impossible to accelerate and climb after takeoff. During an attempted forced landing, the aircraft struck trees."
53,ACC1424,"The Caravan was chartered to fly a party of eight to Estancia La Cristina. Among the passengers were the president of the Techint company and the managing editor of the La Nacion newspaper. The flight was planned to depart April 26, but was postponed to the 28th. The airplane was hangared ready to depart. The flight finally departed early in the morning from San Fernando's runway 24. Baires Control cleared the pilot to climb to FL60. After reaching that altitude the pilot requested permission to fly direct to the Padex waypoint and climb to FL 080. Permission was granted. At 04:54 the pilot requested another climb clearance for FL100 to get out of the clouds. This was allowed after conflicting traffic had crossed his path. Because icing conditions existed at that altitude, a further climb to FL120 was requested and obtained. The Cessna apparently lost control, spiralled down and crashed in rugged farm country."
54,ACC1425,"The Cessna Caravan was carrying 11 skydivers and climbed to FL140. As the first team of four exited the aircraft, the middle parachutists reserve parachutes pilot chute deployed. Due to the bent over position of that parachutist, the action of the ejector spring in the pilot chute pushed the chute upwards and over the horizontal stabiliser of the aircraft, pulling the reserve canopy with it. The parachutist passed below the horizontal stabiliser resulting in the reserve parachute risers and lines tangling around the left elevator and horizontal stabiliser. Eleven seconds later, the empennage separated from the aircraft and the left elevator and the parachutist separated from the empennage. The aircraft then entered a steep, nose-down spiral descent. The pilot instructed the remaining parachutists to abandon the aircraft; the last one left the aircraft at an altitude of 9,000 feet. The pilot transmitted a mayday call, shutdown the engine and left his seat. On reaching the rear of the cabin, he found that the roller blind had closed, preventing him from leaving the aircraft. After several attempts, the pilot raised the blind sufficiently to allow him to exit the aircraft, and at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet agl, he deployed his parachute and landed safely."
55,ACC1426,"An automatic landing on runway 27 was carried out with the first officer being the pilot flying. The right main landing gear failed immediately upon touchdown. The aircraft slid along the runway and came to a halt some 1,600 metres further on, resting on its right flaps, slats and wingtip. An emergency evacuation was carried out. Examination of the aircraft showed that the right main gear strut cylinder had fractured below the attachment trunnions, releasing the wheels/axle assembly back into the flaps and wing/fuselage fairing. The lower portion of the failed cylinder remained attached only by the sidestay. A closer inspection revealed the presence of an anomaly on the forward outer surface of the cylinder fracture, which subsequent examination identified as a fatigue crack measuring approximately 3.5 mm long and 1.1 mm deep."
56,ACC1427,"First Air flight 953 departed Edmonton at 11:30. As the aircraft approached Yellowknife, the spoilers were armed, and the aircraft was configured for a visual approach and landing on runway 33. The computed Vref was 128 knots, and target speed was 133 knots. While in the landing flare, the aircraft entered a higher-than-normal sink rate, and the pilot flying (the first officer) corrected with engine power and nose-up pitch. The aircraft touched down on the main landing gear and bounced twice. While the aircraft was in the air, the captain took control and lowered the nose to minimize the bounce. The aircraft landed on its nose landing-gear, then on the main gear. The aircraft initially touched down about 1300 feet from the approach end of runway 33. During the third touchdown on the nose landing-gear, the left nose-tire burst. The aircraft was taxied to the ramp and shut down. The aircraft was substantially damaged."
57,ACC1428,"An Antonov 2 biplane was destroyed when it crashed on the banks of the Akhtuba River, Volgograd Region, Russia. All three on board were killed. The airplane was returning to the airport after parachutists had jumped from the plane. On board were the pilot, a parachutist instructor and a passenger. Probably sitting in the right seat the unfastened passenger slid off the chair and leaned on a control column. The plane went into a nosedive at an altitude of 1000 meters. It impacted the ground at a speed of 310 km/h."
58,ACC1429,"A Gates Learjet 24A, N805NA, made a hard landing at Victorville Airport, California. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was operating the airplane as a public-use flight. The local training flight departed Edwards Air Force Base, California, about 10:55.After completing local air work, the flight proceeded to Victorville to practice touch-and-go landings. The pilot made the first touch-and-go. The copilot successfully made the second touch-and-go. The copilot attempted the third touch-and-go. At 50 feet, he disengaged the yaw damper and entered a pilot induced lateral oscillation. The airplane rapidly decelerated and developed a high sink rate. The airplane dragged the right wing tip fuel tank, which separated from the airplane, and the airplane bounced back into the air. The airplane landed hard, the main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane skidded to a stop off the right side of the runway. Both pilots and the passenger deplaned through the main entry door. The pilot-in-command stated that he had not demonstrated the handling characteristics of the airplane with the yaw damper off. He felt he did not react quickly enough to prevent the accident."
59,ACC1430,"Widerøe flight WF954 departed Alta at 15:22 for a flight to Båtsfjord. The Localizer/DME approach to runway 21 at Båtsfjord was flown by the co-pilot. After passing the missed approach point the captain took over control because they lost sight of the runway. The approach was continued but the airplane touched down hard on the right hand main gear, which collapsed. The aircraft was shipped to Bodø August 26, 2001 and broken up."
60,ACC1431,"The Ilyushin was operating on a cargo flight from Chkalovsky to Taiyuan, China. Intermediate stops were planned at Noril'sk and Bratsk. Weather at Chkalovsky included fog with a visibility of 500-900 m, vertical visibility 70-80 m, temperature +8deg C. The aircraft was prepared for departure and, according to the loading documents, loaded with 40,2 tons of cargo. The takeoff weight would thus be 191,9 tons. However, the cargo was not properly weighed and the actual takeoff weight was approximately 204 tons, which exceeded the maximum permissible weight by 14 tons. Flaps were set at 30°, slats to 14°, and the stabilizer was at 5,4° airplane nose up. After accelerating down the runway, the captain started to rotate at a speed of 250 km/h (135 kts), lifting off at a speed of 290 km/h (157 kts) after a takeoff run of 2700 m. The undercarriage was raised and at the height of approximately 10  meters, the captain carried out a right-hand turn with a 7 deg bank to compensate for a slight deviation to the left during takeoff. At a height of about 23 m the stabilizer was trimmed from -5,4° to -3,9° without using elevator to compensate. The Ilyushin then descended to about 20 m before it contacted trees, 930 m past the end of the runway. The no. 3 and 4 engines were destroyed by the impact and the airplane descended further until contacting terrain at 1460 m past the end of the runway.The investigation into the cause of the accident revealed a large number of problems in the operations and maintenance of the Russ Air Transport Company, the Atruvera company and also in the flight service organization of Chkalovsky Airport."
61,ACC1432,"The pilot aborted the takeoff from N'Djamena Airport runway 23 around the VR speed. The Viscount ran off the side of the runway, causing substantial damage to the propellers, the no. 1 and no. 3 engines. The airplane was heading back to Transtel's base in Lomé after completing a contract for the Tchadian government. Even though the plane was written off by the insurance company, efforts were made to restore it to flying condition. Just before it was to be in flying condition again, a soldier sleeping under the wing accidently fired his gun, puncturing one of the fuel tanks."
62,ACC1433,"Weather conditions were favourable as the Boeing 727 approached Asmara. However, after some rainfall the 3000 m/9842 feet asphalt runway 25 was still wet. After touchdown the airplane did not decelerate as expected and overran the runway. The main landing gear failed after colliding with a large block of concrete."
63,ACC1434,"The Falcon 20 operated on a chartered cargo flight from Gdansk, Poland to Louisville, KY (USA). Intermediate stops were planned at Copenhagen (Denmark), Keflavik (Iceland), Narsarsuaq (Greenland) and Sept-Îles (Canada). The flight was uneventful until the approach to Narsarsuaq. The crew made a briefing on the runway 07 NDB/DME approach while descending to FL195. At 04:27 UTC, while descending through FL130, Narsarsuaq cleared the crew for an approach at their own discretion. Weather at the time was: wind 080deg at 24 knots, visibility 10 km with broken clouds at 6000 feet and overcast at 9000 feet, light rain.While flying the approach, the crew did not adhere to the Standard Operating Procedures a.o. with regards to altitude calls and checklist reading. Furthermore the GPWS was inoperative and the crew were exposed to peak fatigue. They were awake for 22 hours and were on duty for 16:56 hours. Flight duty time was exceeded by almost three hours. While attempting a visual approach to runway 07 the aircraft descended into a high ground to the left of the runway 07 approach path and broke up."
64,ACC1435,"The aircraft departed Bukavu for a flight to Kampene. An intermediate stop was made at Kama, where some cargo was loaded and passengers boarded the plane. Eight minutes after takeoff from Kama, one of the engines failed. The crew, consisting of two Russian pilots, elected to divert to Bukavu but the aircraft crashed 10 km short. According to survivors the aircraft was overloaded with a.o. arms and ammunition."
65,ACC1436,"The Caribou was on a positioning flight to Port Alsworth to pick up cargo. The airplane was configured for landing with 40 degrees of flaps. During the landing approach, variations in indicated airspeed and ground speed indicated windshear conditions. About 100 to 200 feet above the ground, the airplane encountered a downdraft and began to drift to the right of the runway centerline. The captain increased engine power and applied full left aileron and rudder, but could not gain directional or pitch control of the airplane. The right wing struck trees, short of the runway threshold, increasing the airplane's right yaw. As the airplane neared the ground, the captain pulled the engine throttles off. The airplane struck the ground with the right main landing gear and right front portion of the fuselage. The airplane then pivoted to the right, 180 degrees from the approach heading."
66,ACC1437,"Binter flight 8261 left Melilla 37 minutes late, at 9:37, for a flight to Málaga. The climb and cruise were uneventful and at 10:03 the co-pilot contacted Malaga Approach. The flight was cleared for a runway 32 ILS approach. After switching from the Approach to the Tower radio frequency, a no. 1 engine fire warning was noted by the crew. The co-pilot advised Malaga Tower of the emergency ""estamos en corta final, llevamos fuego en un motor, declaramos emergencia"". The co-pilot followed the emergency procedures, during which both engines were switched off. The plane descended and collided with the post of the first approach lights, 538 meters short of the runway threshold. It slid 220 meters, during which it hit five approach light stanchion and finally hit the embankment of the N-340 motorway. Following the crash, some passengers remained trapped in the aircraft for 10 minutes until its rear door could be opened."
67,ACC1438,"Flight 93 departed New York-Newark (EWR) for San Francisco (SFO) at 08:47. The aircraft was hijacked by four terrorists. The hijackers took over control, reportedly switched off the transponder and changed course to, probably, Washington. At 09:35, near Cleveland, the aircraft changed course to the South and later (09:45) Southwest at FL350. At 10:03 the aircraft crashed out of control in a field near Somerset, PA. The hijackers possibly had the intention to crash the plane into Air Force One, Camp David or perhaps Washington. The aircraft crashed following passengers attempt to take down the hijackers."
68,ACC1439,"The Let L-410UVP-E as cleared for takeoff from runway 28 at Chichén Itzá Airport, Mexico. The aircraft used 2100 meters of the 2800 m long runway.

Just after touchdown, a large coyote ran out of the bush on the right side of the runway and into the aircraft's right hand propeller. The engine and propeller sustained significant damage and the aircraft was taken out of service for engine replacement."
71,ACC1442,"The Antonov was prepared for a flight from Polyarnyj to Olenek, carrying one passenger and a load of 500 kg. The flight was delayed because of bad weather at Polyarnyj. After the front had passed, the captain decided to take off. After takeoff the Antonov entered an area of worsening visibility and icing. The pilot changed course in order to evade the icing conditions. However because of airframe icing engine vibrations with a loss of engine power, the pilot decided to return to Polyarnyj. He verified that carburetor heating was on, but did not change the propeller pitch to remove ice from the propeller blades. Because of a decreasing airspeed the pilot added takeoff power. Carburetor icing finally caused the engine to stop producing enough power. A forced landing was carried out on uneven terrain, causing the structural failure of the airplane."
72,ACC1443,"On the night of October 10 the first major winter weather of the season passed through the Dillingham area. Temperatures dropped steadily to about -4deg C. Caravan N9530F had been parked outside and was subjected to rain, snow, causing ice accumulation. Because of these conditions, ramp personnel de-iced the airplane with a heated mixture of glycol and water. The flight departed and climbed to about 650 feet (200 m) msl when the airplane suddenly pitched up, rolled 90 degrees to the left, and yawed to the left. The airplane then descended nose-down until crashing in a level attitude and a flight path angle of about 40 degrees down."
73,ACC1444,"The Beech A100 aircraft departed Barrie-Orillia destined to Windsor, Ontario, Canada. On departure, when the landing gear was raised, the red light in the handle remained on. The flight crew lowered the landing gear but the red light in the handle remained on and the right main gear green light did not illuminate. The flight crew elected to divert to North Bay where maintenance was available. The crew used the alternate gear lowering but the right main gear still did not indicate down and locked. A fly-by before landing in North Bay confirmed that the gear appeared to be down. The flight crew landed on runway 26 and the aircraft decelerated normally until approximately 50 knots when the right main gear slowly collapsed. The right propeller struck the runway followed by the right flap and gear doors. After the aircraft stopped, passengers were evacuated without incident. There were no injuries.  the An initial investigation indicated an actuator failure."
74,ACC1445,Perimeter Flight 962 had departed God's Lake Narrows for a short 27 minute medevac flight to Shamattawa to pick up a patient. The crew were flying a night time approach to runway 01 when they carried out a missed approach because they were too high and too fast. The aircraft flew into trees slightly to the left of the runway centreline in a muskeg area about 2600 feet from the departure end of runway 01. A post-crash fire was confined to the wings which had separated from the cabin and cockpit wreckage.

Poor weather is also rumored to have played a role in the accident."
87,ACC1458,"The flight from Bremerhaven to Wangerooge was planned to depart at 09:30, but was delayed by over half an hour. At that moment a snow shower passed the airport and snowfall continued for 15 minutes. The pilot then prepared the plane for departure. He wiped some snow off the cockpit windows and leading edge of the wings with his hands. At 10:08 the engines were started and the airplane taxied to runway 34 for departure. The aircraft climbed slowly to a height of 195 feet and set course over the Weser River. It then lost height and crashed into the water."
88,ACC1459,"Challenger N90AG was prepared for a flight from Birmingham, UK to Bangor. The flight was cleared to taxi at 12:01 hrs. The captain was pilot-non-flying and was seated in the right cockpit seat. During taxi, the crew completed their normal Before Takeoff Checks; these included confirmation that the control checks had been completed and that anti-ice might be required immediately after takeoff. Flap 20 had been selected for takeoff and the following speeds had been calculated and briefed by the pilots: V1 137 kt; VR 140 kt; V2 147 kt. By 12:06, the aircraft was cleared to line up on runway 15. At 12:07 hrs, N90AG was cleared for takeoff with a surface wind of 140°/8 kt. Takeoff appeared normal up to lift-off. Rotation was started at about 146 kt. Lift-off occurred 2 seconds later, at about 153 kt and with a pitch attitude of about 8 degrees nose-up. Immediately after lift-off, the aircraft started to bank to the left. The rate of bank increased rapidly and 2 seconds after lift-off the bank angle had reached 50 degrees. At that point, the aircraft heading had diverged about 10 degrees to the left. Opposite aileron, followed closely by right rudder, was applied as the aircraft started banking; full right aileron and full right rudder had been applied within 1 second and were maintained. As the bank angle continued to increase, progressively more aircraft nose-up elevator was applied. Stick-shaker operation initiated 3.5 seconds after lift-off. The left winglet contacted the runway shoulder, the outboard part of the left wing detached and the aircraft struck the ground inverted, structurally separating the forward fuselage. Fuel released from ruptured tanks ignited and the wreckage slid to a halt on fire. The last recorded aircraft attitude was approximately 111 degrees left bank and 13 degrees nose-down pitch."
89,ACC1460,"A USMC Lockheed KC-130R Hercules transport plane was destroyed in an accident near Shamsi, Pakistan. All seven crew members were killed.The crew had requested a non-standard approach night time from the northeast, possibly because they were running half an hour late.This request was denied as USMC aircraft were only allowed to land from the southwest to avoid overflying Shamsi at night. The crew then circled over a ridge with their altitude dropping to 3200 feet below the minimum safe altitude.The airplane struck a mountainside at 3800 feet. The crew likely became disoriented while attempting the night landing.The aircraft was attached to VMGR-352, MCAS Miramar, California."

91,ACC1462,"The airplane touched down at Novato Airport's runway 13 about 1/3 of the way down the 3300 feet runway. The pilot applied ground flaps and spoilers, braked hard. The pilot reported that the airplane was not decelerating normally, so he decided to abort the landing. He applied full power for takeoff; however, he forgot to retract the ground flaps and spoilers. The airplane did not liftoff the ground and ran off the departure end of the runway coming to rest in a ditch."
92,ACC1463,"A Boeing 727 cargo plane, N190AJ, sustained substantial damage during an approach to landing at the Kotzebue-Ralph Wien Memorial Airport, Alaska. The airplane was operated by Northern Air Cargo as Flight 20, originating at the Fairbanks Airport, Alaska. It was reported that the pilot was making a visual approach and overshot the centerline of the runway while making the left turn from the base leg to the final segment of the approach. On the final segment of the approach, the pilot made a left, and then a right turn, attempting to realign the airplane with the centerline. During the right turn, the right wing struck the snow-covered ground. The pilot landed the airplane without further incident.The right wing's outboard leading-edge slat and the right wingtip were damaged."
93,ACC1464,"Gulfstream V N777TY was flown to West Palm Beach (PBI) to undergo maintenance. The airplane was on jacks, for a tire change, when a mechanic needed access to the airplane's Maintenance Data Acquisition Unit (MDAU) to check out the problem that the airplane was having regarding false over speed warnings. Since the airplane was on jacks the mechanic had to disable the weight-on-wheel (WOW) switches in order to simulate that the WOW was in the ground mode, not in the air mode, and to gain access to the MDAU. The mechanic said he used a ""Popsicle stick"" to disable these switches. After the maintenance was completed the sticks were not removed, and the inspector that returned the airplane to service was not aware that the WOW switches had been disabled for any reason and no notation was mentioned in the work logs. The aircraft was to be ferried back to Teterboro and shortly after takeoff the landing gear failed to retract. Despite several attempts the crew did not succeed in raising the gear. They elected to land, to evaluate the situation on the ground, and performed an ILS approach back to runway 27R. Shortly before touchdown the power levers were retarded to idle. At that point the spoilers deployed and the aircraft suddenly and abruptly descended to the runway with a very hard, 4.25 g, landing. The right main gear was pushed through the wing causing spilling of fuel on the runway."
94,ACC1465,The aircraft crashed after striking treetops while on final approach to Lakhta.

96,ACC1467,"A Fokker 100 airplane, N1425A, operating as American Airlines Flight 334 experienced an uncontained rupture of the auxiliary power unit's (APU) turbine wheel while operating during de-icing procedures at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Texas. The four crew members and thirty passengers were not injured. AA334 departed gate Alpha 14 at 06:33, and taxied to ramp spot 22 for de-icing. The aircraft was parked at a northeast direction. The ground de-icing crew notified the flight crew to prepare for de-icing. Approximately ten minutes after de-icing began, the captain reported that he heard and felt a ""thud-like"" noise from outside the aircraft. At the same time, the APU shutdown. One of the de-icing crewmembers on the ground stated he saw a flame come from the APU exhaust and discharged the ground APU fire bottle. Approximately the same time, the #2 flight attendant who was seated in the jumpseat at the rear of the cabin, phoned the captain via the intercom and informed him that the emergency first aid kit sustained damage in the form of a three-inch hole in the back of the kit. The flight attendant stated that an apparent impact on the first aid kit had propelled it from the stowed position into the center aisle of the aircraft. The rear cabin jumpseat was located directly in front of the aft pressure bulkhead. The emergency first aid kit was stowed directly onto the aft wall of the cabin underneath the rear cabin jumpseat.Two spray trucks were used to de-ice the airplane with Type 1 de-icing fluid. The five-person crew consisted of a checker, a driver for each truck, and a spray bucket operator for each truck. The members of the de-icing crew stated that at the time they were de-icing the airplane, the wind was blowing at 20 knots and gusting. Due to the windy conditions, the drivers of the de-icing trucks had coordinated prior to de-icing the airplane to start at opposite ends of the airplane so the bucket operators would not be spraying each other as they de-iced the airplane. The bucket operators both stated that at times, the wind was whipping the stream of de-icing fluid such that they could not even see the airplane, let alone where the de-icing fluid was being sprayed. Bucket operator #1 stated that he had completed de-icing the nose, right wing, and right horizontal stabilizer of the airplane, and had just started to de-ice the right side of the vertical fin, when he heard a noise and saw that the APU was on fire. Bucket operator #2 stated that he had de-iced the left horizontal stabilizer, the left side of the vertical fin, and aft fuselage, and after the truck was repositioned, he had started to de-ice the left wing when the checker discovered the APU fire. The bucket operators stated that they knew where the F-100's APU air inlet was located, and were aware that de-icing fluid should not be sprayed into the APU inlet. The Automated Surface Observing Station for DFW at 0700 reported winds from 320 degrees at 20 knots gusting to 27 knots, visibility 2.5 statute miles in freezing rain and ice pellets, overcast skies at 2,500 feet, temperature minus 4 degrees Celsius, dew point minus six degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.01 inches of Mercury. Examination of the airplane revealed APU damage, which was located inside the tailcone. The turbine wheel was found fractured into five pieces. The fracture surfaces were coarse and grainy, with no evidence of fatigue. The impeller was found intact and the impeller vane leading edges had nicks and gouges and were bent opposite the direction of rotation. Ridges on the rear face of the impeller were in line with the vanes on the front face. A fragment of the turbine wheel penetrated the aft pressure bulkhead, and was found embedded in the first aid kit that was stored directly underneath the flight attendant's aft jump seat located at the rear of the cabin. Examination of the APU was conducted at American Airlines' maintenance facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The examination revealed two large holes in the APU's compressor case in line with the turbine wheel's plane of rotation. The turbine wheel was broken into several pieces. The broken pieces of the turbine wheel were submitted to Honeywell's Materials Laboratory for a metallurgical examination that confirmed the APU had experienced an overspeed. Further examination did not reveal evidence of fatigue on any of the fracture surfaces. Additionally, the containment ring was broken into three pieces. The APU has an electronic control unit (ECU) that meters fuel to the APU while it is in operation. The ECU monitors the rotor speed and will shut off fuel to the APU if it senses an overspeed, which is 107 percent. The ECU was removed from the engine and shipped to Honeywell's Anniston, Alabama facility to interrogate the ECU's non-volatile memory (NVM) and perform a diagnostic test. The NVM indicated that the APU had experienced an overspeed, which is a rotor speed of 107 percent or greater, and had commanded a shutdown. The diagnostic test showed that there were no discrepancies with the ECU.A review of American Airlines' de-icing training program showed that each of the 5 had completed annual refresher training in de-icing procedures for the F-100. During de-icing training, personnel are advised not to spray the F-100 APU inlet area, and crews are furnished diagrams of each type of airplane that highlight prohibited spray areas.In February 2001, American Airlines issued a 'Winterization Bulletin' for the F-100 advising that de-ice spray should not be sprayed into the APU inlet. Additionally, the F-100 maintenance manual section 12-31-00, page 301 specifically advises, ""Do not let de-icing and/or anti-icing fluid/water mixture go into the APU inlet. Injury to persons and/or damage to equipment can occur."" American Airlines' policy had been to operate the APU during de-icing. As a result of this event, pilots were instructed to not operate the APU during de-icing operations, and to refer to the operating manual and follow procedures for de-icing with an inoperative APU. De-icing crews were also informed of the change in de-icing procedures, regarding the operation of the APU.As a result of this event, on March 29, 2002, the National Transportation Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation A-02-05 that recommended the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) immediately issue an airworthiness directive (AD) for the Fokker F-28 MK-100 and F-28 MK-4000 airplanes that prohibits APU operation during de-icing operations. The FAA issued AD 2001-07-03 that prohibits the operation of the APU during de-icing operations for all series of the F-28 airplane."

98,ACC1469,"The Britten Norman Islander was being loaded with avgas for a company flight from Elk Island, MB to Bolton Lake. Hazmat-trained personnel were transferring the fuel from a large stationary tank with a gasoline-powered pump to an approved tank in the aircraft. When the pump was shut off, it backfired and a small fireball ignited at the pump and traveled into the aircraft. A fire ensued, which consumed the aircraft. No personnel were in the aircraft and no-one was injured."
99,ACC1470,"A Mitsubishi MU-300, N617BG, was substantially damaged during a landing overrun on runway 30 at Anderson Municipal-Darlington Field Airport (AID), Indiana. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The two flight crew members and four passengers were uninjured. The captain, who was also the company chief pilot and check airman, was the flying pilot, and the first officer was the non flying pilot. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Area weather reporting stations reported the presence of freezing rain and snow for a time period beginning several hours before the accident. The captain did not obtain the destination airport weather observation until the flight was approximately 30 nautical miles from the airport. The flight received radar vectors for a instrument landing system approach to runway 30 (5,401 feet by 100 feet, grooved asphalt). The company's training manual states the MU-300's intermediate and final approach speeds as 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and Vref, respectively. Vref was reported by the flight crew as 106 KIAS. During the approach, the tower controller gave the option for the flight to circle to land or continue straight in to runway 30. He advised that the winds were from 050-070 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots, and runway braking action was reported as fair to poor by a snow plow. Radar data indicates that the airplane had a ground speed in excess of 200 knots between the final approach fix and runway threshold and a full-scale localizer deviation 5.5 nm from the localizer antenna. The aircraft appeared to be decelerating normal, according to the captain, until approximately the 3,000 foot marker. At that point the aircraft's deceleration slowed down and the aircraft began to skid. Approaching the end of the runway the captain noticed a drop off at beyond the end of the runway. The visibility was not good enough to determine what was beyond the drop-off. The captain decided to turn the aircraft to minimize the forward speed after exiting runway and to avoid going down the hill. The aircraft came to rest 30 feet beyond the departure end to the right of centerline.The company did not have stabilized approach criteria establishing when a missed approach or go-around is to be executed. The captain stated that he was unaware that there was 0.7 percent downslope on runway 30. The company provided a page from their airport directory which did not indicate a slope present for runway 30."
100,ACC1471,"The Beechcraft B200C Super King Air, C-GIND operated by Voyageur Airways as flight VAL795, was landing on runway 12 at Thunder Bay Airport, ON (YQT). On touchdown, the pilot-not-flying inadvertently raised the landing gear handle instead of moving the propeller controls to full fine. The landing gear warning horn sounded and the aircraft began to descend further. The pilot-flying carried out a go around, and the crew climbed the aircraft to a safe altitude to assess the situation. While circling north of the airport, the crew lowered the landing gear and determined the left main gear indicated unsafe. The emergency gear lowering procedure was carried out, and the crew visually confirmed the left main gear was extended although it was still indicating unsafe. The crew declared an emergency, and landed on runway 12. On touchdown the left main gear collapsed, and the aircraft came to a stop slightly left of the runway centreline. There were no injuries, and the aircraft sustained substantial damage to the flaps, landing gear, and left propeller."

When the first officer selected the landing gear lever to the, the flight crew heard a loud grinding sound originating from the nose gear wheel-well. All three green landing gear indicator lights extinguished; however, the red light in the landing gear handle remained illuminated. The captain observed the nose wheel partially extended and called for the landing gear unsafe emergency checklist. The flight crew declared an emergency with ATC and continued to North Bay. After a fly by of the control tower confirmed the position of the nose gear, the flight landed. The nose gear fully collapsed on touchdown, damaging all eight propeller blades and the nose gear doors."
106,ACC1477,The DC-3 was performing touch and goes after some repair work. An overspin on one of the engines reportedly caused the crew to lose the first and than the second engine. The aircraft was ditched about 50 feet from the shoreline in about 6 feet of water.

The aural stall warning and stick shaker activated, following which the pilots disengaged the autopilot, turned on the engines ignition, activated the engines anti-ice system, and initiated a descent towards Wichita. The pilots shut down the right engine when its exhaust gas temperature (EGT) increased to about 600 ° Celsius and were able to restart it again on the second attempt at about 17,000 feet. The left engine recovered on its own shortly thereafter. The flight then diverted to the Wichita Mid-Continent Airport where it landed safely."
111,ACC1482,"An Airbus A300-600F, N681FE, owned and operated as Flight 1255 by FedEx Express, experienced a tail strike during a rejected takeoff (RTO) at the El Paso International Airport (ELP), Texas. The captain and first officer were not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. Bright night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the scheduled flight. The captain was the pilot flying (PF), and the first officer was the non-flying pilot (PNF). The flight crew briefed a high (ELP elevation 3,958 feet msl), hot (approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit), and heavy departure (TOGW 297,000 pounds; 375,880 MTOGW), as well as an engine-out departure procedure. The flight crew completed the taxi-out and pre-departure checklist without any anomalies and entered the V-speeds (V1 was 139 knots and Vr was approximately 143 knots.) into the flight management system (FMS). Both crewmember's primary flight display (PFD) displayed the V-speeds with the standard blue lines with no discrepancies noted. The PF entered the V2 speed (approximately 143 knots) into the flight control computer in the glare shield and entered 250 knots for the extended speed to 10,000 feet msl. The PNF did not recall being distracted during the checklist or before takeoff procedures. The flight crew requested and was cleared for departure on runway 04. The PF aligned the airplane on the runway and applied standard takeoff power. The fight instruments were cross-checked at 80 knots (PNF called out 80 knots) and the V-speeds were correctly displayed on the PFD. The PNF checked the engine diagnostic page to observe the #2 engine vibrations. According to the PNF, when he looked back at the PFD, the V-speeds were not displayed, and V2 had reset to 100 knots. According to company personnel, the PNF did not look at the speed index (correct raw speed data) on the left side of the PFD. The PNF called ""V1 rotate,"" and the PF responded by establishing an aircraft pitch of approximately 12 degrees. The PF realized the airplane was not climbing or accelerating properly, and the PNF realized the airspeed was approximately 120-125 knots (below V2), called for the PF to lower the nose of the airplane. The captain [PF] lowered the nose, determined the best and safest course of action was to reject the takeoff, and executed a rejected takeoff by pulling the throttles to idle. The flight control computer automatically applied maximum auto brakes, the airplane slowed, and the PF taxied the airplane off the runway at high-speed taxiway P.FedEx maintenance personnel and the ARFF personnel observed two tires had deflated during the rejected takeoff. The airplane was taxied to the ramp for maintenance repairs. The next morning, the first officer found evidence of a tail strike during the walk-around inspection. The FAA inspector, who responded to the accident site, and FedEx maintenance personnel found a 1/4 inch gash approximately 100 yards long with purple paint transfer (consistent with the aircraft paint) approximately 3,000 feet beyond the approach end of runway 04."
112,ACC1483,"The BN-2B Islander operated on a return flight from Roskilde Airport (RKE) to Læsø Airport (BYR) via Anholt. The return part of the flight was uneventful up to the landing at Anholt. After landing the elevator trim was not set to neutral and remained at a 1.5 unit nose down setting which had been used for landing. The pilot did not visit the airport office to obtain wind information. Instead he assessed the wind was across the runway and taxied for a runway 03 departure. In fact the current wind was a tailwind component, which was close to the maximum. On takeoff the pilot tried to raise the nose but during this rotation the aircraft nose dived uncontrolled back on runway again. He attempted a second time with the same result.At this point the pilot considered that it was not possible to stop the aircraft within runway limitations. A third rotation was initiated, whereby the aircraft was in the air immediately after the runway end, while the aircraft stall warning horn activated. The captain lowered the nose of the aircraft to build up airspeed and to avoid a stall. During this maneuver the right main undercarriage struck a sand dune with shrubs, and the airplane impacted terrain."
113,ACC1484,"During maintenance at Maastricht (MST) the right hand main undercarriage was replaced. The landing gear was retracted and deployed several times and performed satisfactory. Prior to being released to the leasing company a test flight was made. During an instrument approach the landing gear was selected down, but the right hand undercarriage did not lock down. The crew recycled the gear and again the right hand main gear came down but failed to lock.The 'alternate gear extension' procedure was followed but it again failed to lock. Upon landing the right had undercarriage collapsed."

At 500 feet, both airplanes touched wing tips; the Cessna's damage was to the right wing and the Britten-Norman's damage was to the left wing. The Britten-Norman's pilot continued the approach and landed without further incident on runway 09. The Cessna's pilot initiated a go-around, for another approach, and landed without further incident on runway 09."
115,ACC1486,"Boeing 767-200 JA8254 took off from Shimojishima Airport at around 11:32 on a flight for takeoff and landing training. A captain acting as instructor occupied the right pilots seat. The left hand seat was occupied by a pilot undergoing training for promotion to first officer. First, trainee pilot-B made seven landings on runway 17 from the left pilots seat, including two landings with one engine simulated inoperative, and a go-around with both engines operative. He then changed places with trainee pilot-A. At around that time, the wind direction changed from the south to the west, and the aerodrome control tower instructed a change to runway 35. Trainee pilot-A then made two landings on runway 35 with both engines operative, and then switched to landing with one engine simulated inoperative. The first landing was made with the left engine simulated inoperative. After that, during a landing with the right engine simulated inoperative, the touch down was late and the trainee pilot attempted to go-around with go-around thrust on the left engine only. A few seconds later the instructor increased power on the right engine to go-around thrust, but at that time even though the left engine thrust had started to increase the right engine was still at minimum idle thrust. As a result, a thrust imbalance occurred between the left and right engines while right rudder was being applied, and the aircraft rolled and yawed to the right. Although the trainee pilot and the instructor attempted to correct the attitude changes, the aircraft veered off the runway into a grass field on east side of the runway and came to a stop around 1,990 m from the point it had first touched down."

The Bell 205A sustained damage to its main rotor system."
117,ACC1488,"The Antonov departed Yakutsk on a crew training flight. Two approach and landings were carried out using flap settings of 38 and 15 degrees. During the third approach the captain called for lowering of the landing gear. The flight engineer moved the landing gear handle from neutral into the ""retract"" position. He did not check for three greens so failed to notice his mistake. Then the captain requested the flaps to be selected at 10 degrees. The Antonov turned to finals, but the crew did not carry out the final approach checks and continued after having obtained landing clearance. Fourteen seconds before touchdown an air traffic controller informed the crew that they should go around because the landing gear was not down. The captain did not hear this because at that moment height and speed were called out by the flight engineer. Five seconds later the controller repeated his warning. One of the crew members heard the call and noticed three reds on the instrument panel. He informed that captain about this, but it was already too late. The captain added takeoff power, but within three seconds the tail struck the runway. The airplane skidded about 1000 metres before coming to rest."

120,ACC1491,"The pilots had initially briefed the approach to runway 27, but since winds were calm a straight in visual approach to runway 09 was attempted. The crews' statements indicate that the base leg was normal and the gear was down and flaps at 30 degrees when the plane impacted trees 3,650 feet short of the runway, generally along the runway centerline. The tops of the trees were broken about 50 feet above ground level. The plane descended through trees until impacting the ground about 1,000 feet later. It slid an additional 1,100 feet - most of it in open field - and came to rest about 1,000 feet from the runway facing in the opposite direction of travel (approximately 260 degrees). The plane struck construction vehicles that were parked on the field during the night. Burn marks on the ground indicate a fire on the plane for the last 1,000 feet or so of travel."

The crew evacuated the aircraft with minor injuries, and AFF was on the scene within 5 minutes and extinguished the fire."
123,ACC1494,"Flight 359 departed Khabarovsk on a passenger flight to Ayan with an intermediate stop at Polina Osipenko. Weather at the destination was reported fine as the crew decided to takeoff from Polina Osipenko. However, weather quickly worsened. The controllers which were in contact with the flight did not have this information, so the crew were unaware of inclement weather in the Ayan area. After contacting the Ayan approach controller the crew were told that the visibility was 5000 metres but that the fog was closing in rapidly. Important meteorological information (cloud base, visibility, RVR) was not available at that moment and thus not relayed to the crew as they were conducting their initial approach. The Antonov descended at an average vertical rate of descent of about 7 m/s. It reached an altitude of 800 metres at a point were it should have been at 950 metres. The crew then made a premature turn to finals. Starting at an altitude of 660 metres (instead of 950) the aircraft during the turn entered into stratus clouds, passing into the fog with the horizontal visibility approximately 50 m. It descended to 320 metres on completion of the turn, having deviated 2,3 km to the right of the extended runway centreline. Instead of aborting the approach, the captain decided to continue. At a height of 188 metres the aircraft collided with the slope of a mountain with a height of 226,4 m.The aircraft was attempting its second approach in fog when it struck a cliff 10 meters below the top at a distance of 4.8 km from the runway, ripping off one wing and the undercarriage. The fuselage and the other wing continued for about 100 meters and crashed in the valley 85 meters below."
124,ACC1495,"The Citation VI operated on a calibration flight to check the Xichang Airport (XIC) ILS of runway 36. While circling for another approach, the aircraft collided with the wooded slope of the mountain at a height of 2560 m which was shrouded in clouds. Airfield elevation is 1560 m and missed approach procedures call for a climb to an altitude of 2750 m before turning left."
125,ACC1496,The DHC-3 Otter took off from Lake de l'Avion near Natashquan Airport at approximately 10:50 on a flight to a hunting camp 57 miles to the north along the Aguanish River.

126,ACC1497,"LGW flight 615 departed Leipzig for Dortmund. While climbing through FL80 at an indicated airspeed of 175 knots, the plane suddenly started to swing. The crew contacted Bremen Radar and reported that they had a rudder failure. They reduced the speed to 120 knots upon which the swinging stopped. The crew decided to divert to Paderborn-Lippstadt and were cleared for a straight-in approach to runway 24. The aircraft landed safely at 18:40. On the ground it appeared that the metal sheeting of the rudder had separated completely on both sides of the rudder. The rudder had just recently been fitted with new sheeting, which had been done without using the guidelines issued by the manufacturer."
127,ACC1498,"The aircraft departed Calgary Airport at 22:20 the previous evening on a charter flight to Teesside Airport. Upon nearing Teesside, the crew prepared for a runway 05 ILS approach. The Teesside ATIS current at the time of the landing was reporting a surface wind of 360°at 12 kt variable between 350° and 080° with visibility of 9 km in light rain showers with scattered cloud at 2,500 feet and 4,800 feet. The temperature was +8°C and the Dew Point +5°C, QNH 1003 mb with the runway surface reported as wet. As the aircraft was radar vectored for the approach, it was correctly configured for landing with 30° of flap lowered and the landing gear selected down with medium auto-brake set. The ILS approach was initially flown using the autopilot to capture the localiser and glide-slope with the flight director coupled and engaged in the approach mode. At an altitude of 1,500 feet the commander was satisfied that the approach was stabilised and disengaged the autopilot. When the autopilot was disengaged, the airspeed was 142 kt, four knots below VAPP. A line of rain showers were located across the approach, which the commander described as ""like a curtain of rain just short of the runway threshold, which did not appear to reach the ground"". he aircraft was cleared to land and the surface wind of 010° at 10 kt was passed by ATC. The runway lights were clearly visible through the rain and the approach was continued visually without difficulty. The aircraft maintained a stable approach until a height of 200 feet when airspeed reduced from 144 kt to 132 kt in four seconds, with the aircraft descending half a dot below the glidepath which activated the GPWS aural warning of ""glideslope"". The commander reported seeing three red lights and one white light on the PAPIs for which he took corrective action to regain the glide-slope. At 40 feet the speed had reduced to 129 kt and the commander described the sensation of the aircraft being sucked down onto the runway. He applied aft control column to arrest the rate of descent and the aircraft touched down heavily but it did not appear to bounce. The speed brakes deployed and using reverse thrust together with manual braking from 80 kt, the aircraft was slowed to a stop by the intersection with Taxiway B, a landing distance of approximately 4,400 feet. After shutdown a ground inspection of the underside of the tail section revealed that the aircraft's tail had struck the runway, causing damage to the fuselage underside extending over an area approximately 28 feet in length. Pitch attitude at main gear touch down should have been 4.5° but due to the low airspeed, it increased to 8° at 50 feet and 11.5° at touchdown, partly because thrust was retarded to idle during the flare."

129,ACC1500,"Tyumenaviatrans flight 9012 was a chartered service from Asmara, Eritrea to Antalya, Turkey with an route stops at Port Sudan and Hurghada. The aircraft, an Antonov An-26B, was to fly helicopter crews back to Russia. When the flight departed Hurghada, weather forecasts for Antalya were fine. However, when descending towards Antalya, a thunderstorm had formed near the airport. The controller stated that winds were 220 degrees at 35 knots with a visibility of 2000 m.In conditions of thunderstorm activity and heavy rainfall, the crew deviated to the left of the landing course and took road side lights leading to the platform as runway lights. The captain noticed the error and ordered an increase in engine power to go around.However, the airplane collided at a height of 10 m with a power transmission pole (1325 m from the runway threshold, 550 m to the left of its axis). As a result of which the left wing separated. The aircraft slid and the right wing hit road lighting."
130,ACC1501,"The aircraft departed Vancouver at 19:18. The first officer was the flying pilot. When the aircraft arrived at Sandspit, the surface wind was strong, gusty, and across the runway (220 degrees magnetic at 30 knots, gusting to 37 knots). The crew conducted an instrument approach to runway 30, and the airplane touched down on its belly. After initial contact with the runway, the aircraft bounced several times with diminishing force as it slid down the runway. It then veered to the right side of the runway, breaking five runway lights with its right wing, veered to the left, and came to a stop about 500 feet from the end of the runway."
131,ACC1502,"While climbing through FL110, the crew heard a loud 'bang' and felt the aircraft move to the right, followed by a progressive yaw to the left. After checking instrumentation, the failure of the left (number-one) engine was confirmed and the engine was shut down. An emergency was declared and the aircraft returned to Brisbane. An initial engineering examination of the left engine revealed a large rupture of the outboard core cowl and severe gouging and scoring of the outboard side of the engine strut above the cowl damage. The leading edge flap panel above the strut was extensively damaged over approximately 40cm and the no. 2 canoe fairing behind the engine sustained debris impact and puncture damage. Inspection of the engine core beneath the ruptured cowl revealed that the first-stage high-pressure turbine disk had failed and released a large segment of the disk rim and outer web. The engine casing around the disk had been completely severed and the central shaft fractured between the stage-one and stage-two high-pressure turbine disks."
132,ACC1503,"Flight BE 046 departed Birmingham at 12:52 for a flight back to Belfast. During the climb, the flight crew noticed that the aircraft was oscillating in pitch more than was customary. The autopilot remained engaged for significant portions of the climb but the level-off at FL240 was flown manually. Shortly after establishing level flight, the autopilot was re-engaged but the aircraft began to oscillate in pitch and diverge from its assigned flight level. The captain disengaged the autopilot and was immediately aware of a strong pitch-up tendency. He applied an increasing forward pressure on the control column and supplemented this with electric elevator trim in the nose-down sense. At FL242 the aircraft was reported to have pitched down at a marked rate. Having pitched to below the straight and level attitude, the captain then tried to counter this with a progressive rearwards force on the controls. Both pilots then pulled back with considerable force. The control column suddenly moved aft, the aircraft pitched up and the flight crew felt a violent shudder through the whole airframe that lasted for two or three seconds. After this the control forces returned to normal and they were able to level the aircraft at FL240. During the pitching manoeuvres, two of the three cabin crew had fallen in the cabin aisle, sustaining serious injuries. The elevator control difficulties might have been caused by natural icing; investigation is still ongoing."
133,ACC1504,Flew into a cliff during the inaugural flight from the newly constructed Gohu Airstrip in the rugged Finisterre Mountains.
134,ACC1505,"The airplane climbed to about 800 feet above the ground and the airspeed increased to about 55 knots, the pilot heard a very loud bang, followed by a loud rattling noise. He said that as he was attempting to turn the airplane around and return to the departure airstrip, he experienced considerable difficulty in maintaining longitudinal directional control using the airplane's rudder pedals. Using a combination of aileron control, and the remaining amount of rudder control, he was able to maneuver the airplane for an easterly landing on the airstrip. The pilot said that as the airplane passed over the approach end of the airstrip, the airplane drifted to the right, and he initiated a go-around. The airplane subsequently collided with a stand of trees on the south side of the airstrip, and sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage."
135,ACC1506,"The pilot took off with full flaps, and lost control of the plane at 200-300 feet. The airplane stalled and crash-landed in a cassava field."
136,ACC1507,"The captain said that he was landing the airplane on runway 33 with a 15-knot crosswind from his right (about 050 degrees magnetic). During the landing roll, the airplane drifted too far to the left on the ice and frost-covered runway and encountered a snow berm. The collision with the snow berm fractured the nose wheel fork, and a portion of the fork subsequently damaged the fuselage just aft of the nose wheel. Field repairs were made at Kipnuk, and the airplane was ferried to the operator's main repair base in Anchorage."
137,ACC1508,"The Beech 99 departed Pikangikum, at 18:38 on a night VFR flight to Poplar Hill. The captain, who was the pilot flying and sitting in the right-hand seat, completed a normal takeoff. The flight took off from runway 27, over a lake. About 400 feet above ground level, the captain began a climbing right turn en route. During the turn, she had difficulty seeing the artificial horizon and concentrated on the aircraft's bank angle. The first officer called that the aircraft was in a 2000-feet-per-minute descent and took control. The aircraft struck the frozen surface of the lake, bounced, and became airborne again. The first officer retained control, and the captain attempted to feather the damaged right propeller. The first officer, believing that both propellers had sustained damage, force-landed the aircraft on the lake surface. The aircraft sustained substantial damage."
138,ACC1509,"The aircraft had landed slow and hard at Vancouver and  momentarily rotated beyond its compressed-strut nose up limit. This caused damage to the aft belly skin. The aircraft was ferried to Everett, Washington, where a major repair was performed on the damaged skin and fuselage strap."
139,ACC1510,Crashed 330 feet below a peak in the Sirach Mountains. All aboard were members of the Revolutionary Guards.
140,ACC1511,"The aircraft departed Islamabad at 08:00 for a flight to Kohat Air Base. Pakistani air force chief Mushaf Ali Mir was to conduct an annual inspection of the air base. The aircraft crashed into the side of a 3,000-foot mountain, covered in fog."
141,ACC1512,"The Let 410 was involved in skydiving flights out of Borki aerodrome. The aircraft in question was owned by Mr Yu. M Kabanov, deputy director of the Aviation Complex Myachkovo (AKM) and used by the Borki Air Club. On the day of the accident 23 skydivers boarded the Let 410. This was illegal since the maximum number of skydivers allowed on a Let 410 is 12 with lateral seating. In this case nearly all skydivers were sitting on the airplane's floor, one even occupied the toilet. As a result the airplane was overloaded by 618 kg and the centre of gravity was probably about 32% MAC where the maximum rear CofG was 28% MAC. At an altitude of about 3900 metres eleven skydivers prepared to exit the plane. When four of them had gotten out the CofG moved further aft (probably to about 35%) causing the Let to pitch up. The plane stalled, fell to the left and descended out of control. At an altitude of 2000 metres the aft fuselage section failed. Several skydivers were thrown out and the airplane crashed in a field."
142,ACC1513,"After having been cleared to enter the Kotzebue airspace, the pilot established a GPS waypoint 4 miles (6,4 km) from runway 08 and descended to 1,000 feet. He continued inbound and descended to an altitude of 300 feet. At one mile from the airport, the pilot said he looked up from the instrument panel but could not see the airport. He also stated that he was in a whiteout condition. The airplane collided with the snow-covered sea ice, short of the runway threshold."
143,ACC1514,"The Zip Boeing 737-200, C-GKCP, was operating as flight 201, from Calgary to Vancouver, Canada. While final baggage loading was taking place, a belt loader struck the aircraft belly at low speed. The collision resulted in serious injuries to the belt loader operator and damage to the aircraft. The flight was subsequently cancelled and passengers off-loaded.  Number of passengers and crew unknown."
144,ACC1515,"The Caravan plane N5512B was the second plane used on classified counter-drug intelligence missions on behalf of the U.S. military. The other Caravan N1116G had crashed near Florencia on February 13. Three crew members were taken hostage by FARC rebels in the area. N5512 departed Bogota and landed at the Larandia Air Base where it refueled. At 19:06 the airplane departed Larandia for a reconnaissance flight to find three Americans who where taken hostage. It banked slightly west after takeoff, then turned northeast towards a mountainous area. Nine minutes after takeoff, 13 miles from the runway, the Cessna contacted a large tree on a ridgeline at an altitude of about 4500 feet. The airplane yawed violently, rolled into a near vertical dive and impacted the bottom of a brush-covered gully 1500 feet below the ridge where the aircraft disintegrated on impact and caught fire."
145,ACC1516,"The aircraft crashed into a mountain at 7000 feet, about three minutes after takeoff."
146,ACC1517,"The Antonov 12 transport plane was used to fly supplies to the floating station ""The North Pole - 1/32"". Weather conditions were below landing minima for the airport. The approach was continued, but the plane crash-landed 650 m short of the runway."
147,ACC1518,"A Grumman HU-16 amphibian airplane, N7026Y, was destroyed following a loss of control during the turn from base to final approach near Chetumal, State of Quintana Roo, in the Republic of Mexico. The instrument rated private pilot and his 2 passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was owned and operated by the pilot. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight for which a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Tulum at 17:30 with Chetumal (CTM) as its intended destination.Local authorities reported the airplane had been cleared to land on runway 10 at the Chetumal International Airport. Witnesses reported that the airplane rolled and nosed over during the turn from left base to final approach. The airplane came to rest about 4 miles from the threshold of runway 10. A post-impact fire consumed the airframe."
148,ACC1519,"The Swearingen Metro, C-GERW operated by Northern Dene Airways as flight KA1050, was starting engines on apron one at Saskatoon. A baggage handler for another operator was towing a train of three baggage carts. The last two baggage carts separated from the train, crossed the apron, and struck the left propeller of the aircraft. One baggage cart was propelled under the aircraft into the right propeller. There were no injuries, and the aircraft sustained substantial damage."
149,ACC1520,"The aircraft was approximately 4000 feet asl when the crew selected the flaps for the approach to Prince Albert. A bang was heard from the rear of the fuselage. The aircraft commenced an uncommanded pitch-up to a near-vertical attitude, then stalled, nosed over, and began a spin to the left. The crew countered the spin but the aircraft continued to descend in a near-vertical dive. Through the application of full-up elevator and the manipulation of power settings, the pilots were able to bring the aircraft to a near-horizontal attitude. The crew extended the landing gear and issued a Mayday call, indicating that they were conducting a forced landing. The aircraft struck a knoll, tearing away the belly cargo pod and the landing gear. The aircraft bounced into the air and travelled approximately 180 metres, then contacted a barbed-wire fence and slid to a stop approximately 600 metres from the initial impact point."
150,ACC1521,"N138BF was the first of two conforming prototypes of the SJ30-2 business jet. The aircraft departed San Antonio for flight test number 231 for flight flutter certification. The first flutter mission, flight test number 230, was flown one day earlier with the same pilot onboard. The pilot terminated the flight after an uncommanded roll to the left, and a subsequent discrepancy was noticed between his displayed airspeeds and those reported by a chase plane pilot. After takeoff, the airplane climbed to 39,000 feet and set up for a shallow dive along a 090-degree track. This time no problems were noted. The airplane subsequently turned back to the west and began to climb back to 39,000 feet to set up for another dive to the flight test point along a 270-degree magnetic track. This run also was uneventful. The pilot was then cleared to the next test point. However, the pilot did not acknowledge the clearance, but instead, reported that the airplane was rolling to the right, and he couldn't stop it. About 30,000 feet, the test airplane began rolling to the right. The rolling maneuver appeared to be stable, and continued unchanged until ground impact. The airplane rolled about 7 times during a 49-second timeframe, from about 30,500 feet until a near-vertical ground impact.Although the manufacturers engineering analysis (which did not include any high-speed wind tunnel testing) had predicted positive lateral stability up to Mach 0.90, lateral control was lost during the accident flight below that speed. After the accident, the company conducted high-speed wind tunnel tests, and found that lateral stability decreased with increasing Mach and angle of attack (AOA). Lateral stability became negative (unstable) above Mach 0.83, and rudder input intended to augment lateral trim above a certain Mach could aggravate the situation."
151,ACC1522,"Crash-landed near Mulia. On March 27, 2003 another Air Regional Twin Otter crashed near Mulia."
152,ACC1523,"The Antonov overran runway 25 and collided with several approach lights and two stop way lights. The plane suffered irreparable damage to the propellers, landing gear and fuselage. Wind was reported as 170 deg at 10 kts."
153,ACC1524,"The pilot reported that for takeoff, both fuel selectors were ON, and his initial climb was conducted at 90 to 100 knots, with a 10 to 15 degree pitch attitude. He momentarily leveled at 2,200 feet, and sensed a decrease in engine torque. The low fuel pressure light illuminated, and the fuel flow was lower than normal. The pilot turned the boost pump and ignition ON, and there was no change in engine condition or fuel flow, and the low fuel pressure light remained illuminated. He then advanced the power lever to the full power position, and there was no response from the engine. The pilot heard what he thought was an engine noise, which he described as a decreasing sound. He set up for a forced landing in a field. The airplane came to rest near a residence, inverted."
154,ACC1525,"A Learjet U-36A plane, serial 9202, was damaged beyond repair in a landing accident at Iwakuni MCAS, Japan. All four crew members were killed. The airplane operated on a local flight out of Iwakuni MCAS.The Learjet departed Iwakuni MCAS around 9 o'clock for a training exercise of the Sea of Japan. The airplane returned at 10:45 to practice touch-and-goes on runway 02. During one of these touch-and-goes the plane lost control, crashed on the left side of the runway and burst into flames."
155,ACC1526,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter, registered C-GGON, sustained substantial damage in an accident 4 km east of Lac du Bonnet, MB, Canada. All three passengers and the pilot survived. The airplane operated on a flight from Lac du Bonnet, MB to George Lake, MB.The pilot completed a normal takeoff from the Winnipeg River in an easterly direction and began a shallow climb over the shoreline. As the aircraft levelled at approximately 400 feet agl, there was a loud backfire followed by a complete loss of engine power. The pilot force landed straight ahead; the aircraft struck several large trees and came to rest in a swampy area. The aircraft struck the ground on its left side, both wings broke off, and the engine was buried in the swampy ground."
156,ACC1527,"The aircraft was carrying out a charter flight from Hannover, Germany to Leeds Bradford Airport. There were eight passengers on board and the intention was for a return flight to take place later on the same day. The weather conditions recorded at 1320 hrs (5 minutes before the accident) were as follows: surface wind 240°/6 kt, varying in direction between 170° and 290°, visibility 16 kilometres, few cloud at 2,500 feet, temperature 18°C and QNH 1022 mb. The aircraft arrived in the Leeds area from the south and was vectored towards the left-hand downwind position for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to runway 14. At this time the first officer was the pilot flying. As the aircraft neared the airfield, the commander established visual contact and requested a visual approach. The first officer was still the handling pilot but was being given some guidance by the commander during the descent and subsequent turn onto final approach. At around five miles on the final approach the commander took over as handling pilot and the aircraft was passed a landing clearance by Air Traffic Control (ATC). At this stage the aircraft was established on the visual glidepath, 3.5° for this runway, in a clean configuration at an airspeed of 220 kt. The aircraft continued descending on a 3.5° glidepath. At approximately 2 nm from the runway threshold an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) Mode 4 ""TOO LOW TERRAIN"" alert was received. With the aircraft at 1.5 nm the speedbrake was extended and shortly after this, at a speed of 210 kt, 15° of flap was selected. Between 1.5 and 1.0 nm, ATC advised the crew that the landing gear was not down, to which the commander replied ""WE KNOW"". The landing gear was then selected down and, shortly afterwards, at a speed of 195 kt, full flap was selected. A second ""TOO LOW TERRAIN"" alert sounded twice but the repeat was interrupted by the auto callout ""MINIMUMS"" which occurred at 200 feet agl. Immediately afterwards there was one further ""TOO LOW TERRAIN"" aural alert and then a ""SINK RATE SINK RATE"" alert. The aircraft began the landing flare in the region of the touchdown zone at a speed of 155 kt, floated for a considerable distance along the runway and then touched down beyond the runway mid-point at a speed of 121 kt. After touchdown the commander applied full reverse thrust but did not use the wheelbrakes immediately. Wheel braking commenced at around 1,900 feet (585 metres) from the end of the paved surface and continued until the aircraft started to run onto the grass. The aircraft left the paved area at a speed estimated to be 20 kt to 30 kt and came to rest in a nose-down attitude."
157,ACC1528,"The DHC-6-300 amphibious aircraft was performing firefighting operations in the vicinity of Lake Wicksteed. The aircraft was scooping water from Lake Wicksteed for the nearby fire. This was the third scooping from the lake, and the approach was flown in an easterly direction in light wind conditions. The pilot performed the inbound checks, lowered the water probes to begin filling the float water tanks, and touched down on the lake. Within a short time, he observed water spraying from the overflow vents located on top of the floats, indicating that the tanks were filled to capacity. He pressed a button on the yoke to retract the probes, and the aircraft immediately nosed over into the lake in a wings-level attitude and began to sink. The aircraft came to rest on the bottom of the shallow lake in an inverted attitude with the floats above the surface of the water."
158,ACC1529,"In May and June 2003 maintenance work was performed on RA-65929. Amongst others the rudder actuators were replaced. Immediately after installation of these actuators the deflection speed for right rudder input decreased from 38,2 degrees per second to 18,3 degrees per second on the day of the accident. Noticeable more pressure was necessary for full rudder deflection. Although the captain noticed this prior to departure, he decided to continue anyway. During takeoff from Nyagan's runway 16/34 the aircraft began to deviate to the left of the centerline. This movement could insufficiently be countered by applying rudder. So, while accellerating through 150 km/h, the captain decided to use nosewheel steering. One of the tyres on the nosegear then failed. At a speed of 250 km/h takeoff was abandoned. Neither spoilers nor emergency brakes were used, so the Tupolev could not be brought to a halt on the 2530 m long runway and overran the runway by 577 metres. The nosegear collapsed and the aircraft sustained substantial damage."
159,ACC1530,"Shortly after takeoff from Boufarik Air Base, an engine caught fire. The Hercules crashed into the Beni Mered district on the outskirts of Blida, destroying at least four houses."
160,ACC1531,"Several small forest fires had erupted near Cranbrook and the Air Spray Electra Tanker 86 was called in to fight the fires. Accompanied by a Turbo Commander the Electra took off from Cranbrook at 12:10. The Turbo Commander assessed the appropriate aircraft flight path profiles and established the most suitable fire-retardant delivery program for the ground fire. Following the flight path demonstrations by the Turbo Commander aircraft, Tanker 86 proceeded to carry out the retardant drop on the fire. After delivering the specified retardant load, Tanker 86 was seen to turn right initially then entered a turn to the left. In a left angle of bank of about 70 degrees and nose-low the Electra then struck the terrain on the side of a steep ridge at about 3900 feet above sea level. The aircraft exploded on impact."
161,ACC1532,"About 15 minutes after takeoff from Victoria, while climbing through FL160 (en route to FL330), the airplane abruptly nosed over to approximately a forty-degree nose-down angle. The pilot disconnected the autopilot, throttled back to idle, and attempted to re-trim the airplane. He reported that the cockpit trim indicator was in the full forward (nose down) position and that neither the manual nor the electric trim actuators would respond to his inputs. After numerous configuration changes and unsuccessful attempts to regain full pitch control, the pilot elected to ditch the airplane in the water at Penns Cove, 200 yards from shore. Both occupants swam ashore."
162,ACC1533,"The Citation carried out a visual approach to the Sorocaba Airport. After landing the crew lost control of the aircraft. It overran the runway, went down a drop off and skidded into a street in the Vila Helena quarter. The airplane collided with four houses and three vehicles and ended up in a small field. The crash site elevation was 25 meters lower than the runway elevation."
163,ACC1534,"A Beechcraft 400A, N51NP, experienced a loss of directional control on takeoff from St. Augustine Airport, Florida, USA. The aircraft operated on a positioning flight from St. Augustine Airport, to Hickory Regional Airport, North Carolina.The pilot-in-command (PIC) seated in the right front seat stated the copilot was flying the airplane, and the calculated V1 speed was 107 knots with 10 degrees of flaps selected. The airplane was stopped with the parking brake applied at the D1 intersection, and after being cleared for takeoff, the parking brake was released and a rolling takeoff from runway 31 was initiated. During the takeoff roll at 105 knots, the airplane turned abruptly 30 degrees to the left, and he initiated the aborted takeoff. He applied the brakes, reduced thrust, and applied both thrust reversers. In an attempt to maintain directional control both pilots applied right rudder input and pumped the right brake, but the airplane departed the left side of the runway about 2,000 feet from the departure end of the runway. One of the main landing gears contacted an arresting cable, and the airplane continued onto grass."
164,ACC1535,"The pilot had made a local flight with a passenger from the district. On landing, which was performed with a tailwind component, the aircraft nosed over."
165,ACC1536,"The Caravan departed Fajardo (FAJ) on a flight to Culebra Island (CPX). Approximately 20 miles (32 km) from Fajardo, the airplane suffered an engine failure. The pilot was forced to make an emergency landing in the waters near Flamenco Beach.Isla Nena sued Cessna Aircraft Company, the aircrafts manufacturer, and Pratt & Whitney, the aircraft engines manufacturer, seeking damages for loss of the aircraft, repair costs to the aircraft, lost income during the time the aircraft was out of service and other damages based on tort and strict liability theories for defective products manufacture. The district court dismissed Isla Nenas tort and strict liability claims because the emergency landing caused damage only to the plane itself."
166,ACC1537,"Wasaya Flight 125 departed Pickle Lake (YPL) at 20:57 with an estimated arrival time of 21:36 at Sumer Beaver (SUR). The pilot flew a direct visual flight rules (VFR) routing to Summer Beaver at 3500 feet asl under night visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Ten minutes before landing at Summer Beaver, the pilot broadcast his intentions and activated the aircraft radio control of aerodrome lighting (ARCAL) of the airfield. Witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft's lights as it joined the downwind leg of the airport traffic circuit. During the approach the airplane lost control and struck heavily wooded terrain in a near vertical attitude with the wings level."
167,ACC1538,"A Beechcraft B200 Super King Air, N600BV, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after takeoff from the Funchal Airport (FNC), Portugal. Al ten on board were killed."
168,ACC1539,"The airplane landed high and fast at the Del Rio airport's runway 13, which is a 5000 feet (1524 m) asphalt runway. Preliminary radar information revealed a ground speed of 190 knots over the approach end of runway 13, where the Vref landing speed should have been 116 knots. Eyewitnesses reported that the plane touched down past the intersection for taxiway Charlie, which is located about 1,875-feet short of the departure end of the runway. Breaking action started 630 feet further on. Apparently the aircraft could not be brought to a halt and overran the runway end. The jet plunged off the south end of the runway, crossed Johnson Boulevard and plowed into the Masonic Cemetery where it burst into flames, approximately 1,600 feet beyond the departure end of the runway."
169,ACC1540,"Crashed, two hours and 40 minutes into a flight from Mexicali to Santa Lucía AFB.`The aircraft reportedly had an in-flight fire."
170,ACC1541,"The fire tanker airplane, Air Tanker 99, was on a cross-country positioning flight and collided with mountainous terrain while maneuvering in a canyon near the destination airport. Witnesses who held pilot certificates were on a mountain top at 7,900 feet and saw a cloud layer as far to the south as they could see. They used visual cues to estimate that the cloud tops were around 5,000 feet mean sea level (msl).  They noted that the clouds did not extend all the way up into the mountain canyons; the clouds broke up near the head of some canyons.  When they first saw the airplane, they assumed that it came from above the clouds.  It was proceeding north up a canyon near the edge of clouds, which were breaking up.  They were definitely looking down at the airplane the whole time.  They saw the airplane make a 180-degree turn that was steeper than a standard rate turn.  The wings leveled and the airplane went through one cloud, reappeared briefly, and then entered the cloud layer.  It appeared to be descending when they last saw it.  About 2 minutes later, they saw the top of the cloud layer bulge and turn a darker color.  The bulge began to subside and they observed several smaller bulges appear.  They notified local authorities that they thought a plane was down.  Searchers discovered the wreckage at that location and reported that the wreckage and surrounding vegetation were on fire.  The initial responders reported that the area was cloudy and the visibility was low.  Examination of the ground scars and wreckage debris path disclosed that the airplane collided with the canyon walls in controlled flight on a westerly heading of 260 degrees at an elevation of 3,400 feet msl.  The operator had an Automated Flight Following (AFF) system installed on the airplane.  It recorded the airplane's location every 2 minutes using a GPS.  The data indicated that the airplane departed Prescott and flew direct to the Twentynine Palms VORTAC (very high frequency omni-directional radio range, tactical air navigation).  The flight changed course slightly to 260 degrees, which took it to the northeast corner of the wilderness area where the accident occurred.  At 11:02, the data indicated that the airplane was at 11,135 feet msl at 204 knots.  The airplane then made three left descending 360-degree turns. The third turn began at 6,010 feet msl. At 11:16:57, the last recorded data point indicated that the airplane was at an altitude of 3,809 feet heading 256 degrees at a speed of 128 knots."
171,ACC1542,"Convair 580 ZK-KFU was scheduled for 2 regular return night freight flights from Christchurch to Palmerston North. At 20:32 flight 642 started its takeoff from runway 20 on schedule and climbed to FL210. The flight progressed normally. At 21:13 the Wellington controller cleared the flight to descend initially to FL130 and later to FL110. After contacting Ohakea Control the crew were further cleared down to 7000 feet and were given vectors for the approach to Palmerston. The aircraft descended through an area of forecast severe icing, which was probably beyond the capabilities of the aircraft anti-icing system to prevent ice build-up on the wings and tailplane. The aircraft then probably stalled because of a rapid build-up of ice, pitching the aircraft nose down and probably disorientating the crew. Airspeed increased to 392 kts and the G loading was peaking at 3.21 G. The angle of bank was probably between 50° and 60°. Increasing torsional stress on the wing roots probably caused panels to buckle and separate. At an altitude of 6800 feet the wings and engines started to separate. Nine seconds later the remaining fuselage impacted the sea about vertically and at high speed."
172,ACC1543,"The Antonov was used to transport five barrels of gasoline, totalling 900 kg to Amakinskaya. About one hour and forty minutes after takeoff from Olenek, at an altitude of 1150 m, smoke entered the cockpit. Then the upper part of the engine cowling detached and oil spilled from the engine onto the cockpit windows. The engine then quit. Because the windscreen was obscured by oil, the pilot opened the side windows to be able to look ahead. The pilot carried out a forced landing, during which it hit a tree with the left wings. The airplane sustained substantial damage.It appeared that the PZL Kalisz (Shvetsov) ASz-62IR engine occurred because of the fatigue failure of the case of the first cylinder. This took place due to a manufacturing defect."
173,ACC1544,Forced landing following engine problems.
174,ACC1545,"The aircraft was returning from a routine re-supply flight to Fossil Bluff, a remote field station situated on Alexander Island on the Antarctic Peninsula. The wind for the approach was reported as 360°/10 kt at the Rothera runway anemometer and 070°/20 knots at the area anemometer. The pilot was familiar with this type of condition and decided to make an approach to runway 36 using 20-25 degrees of flap. There was some turbulence on the approach and after landing the pilot had difficulty maintaining directional control and carried out a go-around from the runway. The pilot then decided to make an approach to runway 18, and if necessary, carry out another go-around. The second approach to Rothera appeared normal and touchdown was about 200 metres along the runway. After touchdown the pilot applied some braking, full right rudder, and full left aileron to keep the aircraft straight and the wings level. Bearing in mind that he might have to carry out another go-around from the runway, the pilot used little or no reverse thrust. Initially directional control appeared adequate, but as the aircraft approached the mid-point of the runway it started to veer to the left and at some point the pilot attempted to use nosewheel steering to assist with directional control. Shortly thereafter he decided to carry out a go-around, but the aircraft veered further left. The nosewheel detached and the aircraft tipped to the right to the point where the right wing touched the runway surface and the aircraft flipped over in a forward somersault pivoting about the nose and the right wing tip. The aircraft rapidly came to a halt, inverted, about 520 metres from the runway threshold. The pilot and his passenger, who was seated in the right pilot's seat, attempted without success to shut down the engines using the fuel levers. They vacated the aircraft through the right cockpit window having suffered minor abrasions and some bruising."
175,ACC1546,"The Douglas C-47 owned by the SAA Historic Flight flew to Lanseria (HLA) to carry out a sightseeing flight. Fuel allocated in the aircraft for the flight was 400 US gallons (1514 liters). The aircraft departed Swartkop Aerodrome at 14:10 UTC on a ferry flight to Lanseria from where the sightseeing flight took place. A supernumerary pilot, about to undergo conversion training, was the only other person on board. The purpose of his presence was to observe procedures, flying and handling of the aircraft during the ferry flight. The flight departed Lanseria at approximately 14:55 UTC with 24 passengers on board and landed back at 15:55 UTC. At 16:10 UTC, after the passengers had disembarked, Flight 668 took off from runway 24 at Lanseria for the return flight to Swartkop. At about 6000 ft Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL) and about 1500 ft Above Ground Level (AGL) to the South of and downwind of runway 24R, the left engine failed. The first officer was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot non-flying. The captain switched the left engine booster pump on and changed the left-hand side fuel tank selection from the left main to left auxiliary tank and the left engine recovered. Shortly thereafter the right engine also failed. The first officer commenced a turn towards runway 24 whilst the captain dealt with the problem of now restarting the starboard engine by switching the right engine booster pump on and selecting the right-hand side fuel tank selector from the right main tank to the right auxiliary tank and the left engine recovered. According to the crew the left engine then failed again and so too did the right engine. At this stage the crew saw that they were not going to reach runway 24 and carried out a wheels-up forced landing on an open field. During the process of going into the forced landing on the field the captain continued with his attempts to restart the engines by going through the selection of the different fuel tanks. After the aircraft came to a standstill the crew and the supernumerary pilot evacuated the aircraft."
176,ACC1547,"The Airbus, owned by European Air Transport and operated on behalf of DHL, was hit by a 9K32 Strela-2 shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missile (also known as SA-7) while climbing through 8000 feet shortly after departure from Baghdad. The missile struck the wing and penetrated the no. 1A fuel tank. Fuel ignited, burning away a large portion of the wing. To make things worse, the plane lost all hydraulics and the pilots had to attempt a landing back at Baghdad Airport. After a missed approach they were forced to circle the field until they finally landed heavily on runway 33L, 16 minutes later. The Airbus veered off the left side of the runway, travelled about 600 metres through soft sand, struck a razor wire fence and came to rest on a downslope. The Airbus was repaired and offered for sale in 2005, registered N1452. The aircraft was not sold and was still parked at Baghdad by 2011."
177,ACC1548,"Two Swearingen Metro planes, N60U and N340AE, both operated by Key Lime, taxied for departure at Denver (DEN). The pilot of N340AE reported that he had taxied north on taxiway Mike (M) to the ""M10"" intersection. There were several company aircraft in front of him in line for runway 17R. He came to a complete stop behind a Cessna 404, remaining partially on the M taxiway. The pilot of N60U reported that he was taxiing north on the M taxiway, en route to runway 08 for departure. He had seen the lights from an aircraft holding short of runway 17R; however, he did not see the lights of N340AE until it was too late. The pilot of N60U reported he applied full brakes and used reverse thrust but was unable to avoid hitting N340AE. N340AE, was turned to the right during the collision, entangling its empennage with N60U's empennage. The outer 8 feet of N60U's right wing was severed. The outboard 2 feet of the right propeller's blades showed chordwise scratches, torsional bends, and leading edge gouges and chips. The airplane's empennage was crushed and bent.The bottom empennage of N340AE was scraped and torn. The airplane's left wing tip was bent upward, and showed skin wrinkles. An 8-foot long, 2-foot wide section of the left outboard wing's trailing edge was torn out. The airplane's empennage was crushed and bent."

179,ACC1550,"The McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15F, operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Bogotá to Mitú, Colombia, with a refueling stop at El Yopal. After an uneventful flight the aircraft landed at El Yopal at 15:51 hours local time. Refueling took place and the aircraft departed for Mitú at 16:40 hours. The aircraft climbed to the en route altitude of FL290. Bogotá Control then cleared the flight to descend to FL180 and requested to the crew to contact Mitú Tower. At 17:08 hours the flight crew radioed Mitú Tower, stating they were descending through FL250 at 80 miles from Mitú. The tower controller then cleared the flight to the traffic pattern altitude of 7000 feet and to expect runway 01 for arrival.Less than a minute later, at FL233, the flight crew heard a sudden loud noise, followed by another loud noise. The aircraft then entered an uncontrolled descent until it impacted terrain, killing all three occupants.The wreckage was found on December 28."
180,ACC1551,"FedEx flight 647 departed Oakland at 06:32 PST for a cargo flight to Memphis. The first officer was the pilot flying on that leg. The captain of the flight was a company check airman who was conducting a multi-leg line check for the first officer. The flight was routine until the approach to Memphis.At 12:06 the captain contacted Memphis Approach. He was told to expect an approach to runway 36L. After listening out the ATIS, the captain advised the first officer that the winds were out of ""three twenty at sixteen gusts to twenty two. Ten miles [visibility]. It's still saying wind shear."" At 12:15 Memphis Approach informed the flight that they should expect to land on runway 36R instead of 36L, as previously instructed. Six minutes later the captain radioed that they had the airport in sight. The controller cleared them for a visual approach and instructed the captain to contact Memphis Tower. The tower controller stated: ""FedEx six forty seven heavy, Memphis tower, number two following a heavy Airbus two mile final caution wake turbulence runway three six right. Gain and loss of ten [knots] short final runway three six right, cleared to land."" The airplane was configured for landing and the crew discussed adding 4 knots to the Vref speed.A single tailwind shear alert sounded about 12:23:52. Moments later the airplane descended through 1000 feet. The captain confirmed the approach was stable and the approach to land was continued.During the 20 seconds before touchdown, the airplane's descent rate was 12.5 feet per second (fps) with +/- 2.5-fps oscillations. At 12:25:52, the airplane's left main landing gear touched down at a rate of about 12.5 fps; about 0.25 second later, the right main landing gear touched down at a rate of about 14.5 fps. The MD-10 landing gear is designed to be capable of absorbing energy that is equivalent to a maximum airplane descent rate of 12 fps.The excessive vertical and lateral forces on the right main landing gear during the landing exceeded those design limits and resulted in the fracture of the outer cylinder and the collapse of the right main landing gear. The airplane began to bank and turn to the right. The crew were unable to steer the airplane back to the left and it skidded off the right side of the runway and came to a stop in the grass. Shortly after coming to a stop there was an explosion and a fire developed on the right side to the airplane. All seven occupants were able to successfully evacuate the airplane using the cockpit windows."
181,ACC1552,"Weather at Libreville Airport was poor with rainshowers around the airport. According to passenger statements Flight 471 circled the airport for about 30 minutes before trying to land. The Boeing 737 touched down on runway 16, a 3000 m (9843 ft) asphalt runway.From the data, it appears that, after touchdown, the left engine throttle lever was advanced in the forward thrust direction, while the right engine reverser was deployed and subsequently deactivated. The forward thrust from the left engine overpowered the brakes, resulting in the airplane exiting the departure end of the runway at a speed over 100 kts. The 737 crashed through the airport boundary fence before coming to rest a few 100 m past the end of the runway. The airplane was reportedly damaged beyond repair.There is no indication on the CVR that the crew was initiating a go-around."
182,ACC1553,"Union des Transports Africains de Guinée operated two flights a week from Conakry, Guinea to Beirut and Dubai with their newly acquired ex-American Airlines Boeing 727. On December 25, UTA Flight 141 departed Conakry, Guinea for a scheduled flight to Beirut, Lebanon with a planned intermediate stop at Cotonou, Benin and a planned technical stop at Kufrah, Libya. The flight departed at 10:07 carrying 86 passengers and a crew of 10. It arrived at Cotonou at 12:25 were nine passengers disembarked. A total of 63 persons checked in at the airport check-in desk. Ten others boarded from an aircraft that had arrived from Lomé, Togo. Passenger boarding and baggage loading took place in a climate of great confusion. The airplane was full and it is thought that there were more passengers aboard the plane than had officially checked in. In the cockpit, two UTA executives were occupying the jump seats. Faced with the particularly large number and size of the hand baggage, the chief flight attendant informed the captain of the situation. Meanwhile the ground handling companys agents began loading the baggage in the aft hold when one of the operators agents asked them to continue loading in the forward hold, which already contained baggage. When the operation was finished, the hold was full. During this time, the crew prepared the airplane for the second flight segment. The co-pilot was discussing his concerns with the UTA executives, reminding them of the importance of determining the precise weight of the loading of the airplane. The captain determined the limitations for the flight and selected the following configuration: flaps 25°, air conditioning units shut down.At 13:47, the crew began the pre-flight checklist. Calm was restored in the cockpit. At 13:52, they were cleared to roll. The co-pilot was pilot flying (PF). The elevator was set at 6 3/4, it was stated that the takeoff would be performed with full power applied with brakes on, followed by a climb at three degrees maximum to gain speed, with no turn after landing gear retraction. As the roll was beginning, a flight attendant informed the cockpit that passengers who wanted to sit near their friends were still standing and did not want to sit down. The airlines Director General called the people in the cabin to order.It was warm outside at a temperature of 32 deg. C with a light breeze as the flight received permission to takeoff from runway 24. Runway 06/24 is an asphalt runway, measuring 2400 (7874 feet) meters with a 55 m (180 feet) overrun zone. At 13:58:01 the thrust levers were advanced. Fourteen seconds later the brakes were released and the 727 accelerated down the runway. Forty-six seconds after brake release the captain announced V1 and VR speeds. At that moment the aircraft was 1620 m down the runway at a speed of 137 kts. The copilot tried to rotate the plane, but seven seconds later, at a speed of 148 kts and 2100 m down the runway, the nose just slowly rose. The 727 barely climbed, causing the main undercarriage to strike localizer antennas. It then struck the roof of a 2-3 meters high small building housing radio equipment. The operator inside the building suffered injuries. The plane continued, smashed through the concrete airport boundary fence, crashed and broke up on the shoreline. The exact number of occupants and fatalities could not be established with certainty. It is thought that 133 passengers died in the crash with an additional three people of which it was not possible to establish if they were passengers or passers-by on the beach. Most probably however, they were passengers."

During the takeoff roll, the left wing struck a four foot high windrow (snowbank). The pilot lost directional control of the aircraft and it exited the south side of runway 25 at the midpoint. The aircraft came to rest approximately 30 feet off the side of the runway. There were no injuries, but the nose gear was sheared off and the aircraft was substantially damaged. A NOTAM had been issued for the runway stating that there were windrows four feet high, 10 feet inside the runway lights on both sides of the runway. The NOTAM also stated that the cleared portion of the runway was covered with ¼ inch of loose snow over 60 percent compacted snow and 40 percent ice patches and that braking action was fair to poor. The takeoff was being conducted at dusk in conditions of poor lighting and contrast. Crosswind was not a factor."

186,ACC1557,"Uzbekistan Airways' flight HY1154, the evening flight from Termez to Tashkent, departed Termez with a crew of five and an almost full load (32) of passengers. Weather was poor as the flight approached the airport. After reporting capturing the glideslope the air traffic controller reported a vertical visibility of 60 m and a runway visual range of 1300 m. About 12,5 km out, the aircraft's rate of descent increased, causing it to descend below the glideslope. The rate of descent was arrested at a height of 170 m, 8 km from the threshold of runway 08L and they continued in level flight. At the Outer Marker (3,5 km from the runway) they should have started their initial approach, but the crew continued level flight thus flying above the glideslope now. With 2,5 km to go the airplane descended slightly at 1-1,5 m/sec. At the Inner Marker the descent rate increased to 2-2,6 m/sec. The crew then probably saw the runway lights below them. The engines were brought back to idle and reverse thrust was applied at a height of 60 m. When it appeared that they would not be able to land given the remaining runway length, reverse thrust was deselected and engine power was increased. At that point the airplane touched down 260 m past the end of the runway. It continued until the right wing struck a concrete building. The plane then lost the left wing before it crashed through a concrete wall. The airplane broke up, crashed into a ditch and caught fire."
187,ACC1558,"At 15:23 Cessna Caravan C-FAGA was fueled at Windsor Airport, ON (YQG) in preparation for flight GGN125 to Pelee Island, ON. At 15:55, the aircraft was de-iced and departed ten minutes later. The aircraft landed at 16:20. While on the ramp, two individuals voiced concern to the pilot that there was ice on the wing. Freezing precipitation was falling. The pilot was observed to visually check the leading edge of the wing; however, he did not voice any concern and proceeded with loading the passengers and cargo. At approximately 16:38, flight GGN126 departed Pelee Island for Windsor. After using most of the runway length for takeoff, the aircraft climbed out at a very shallow angle. The pilot raised the flaps while over Lake Erie. The Caravan then entered an aerodynamic stall. Because the plane was rolling into a climbing right turn, the left wing stalled first. The nose dropped and the airplane rolled to the left. The airplane was too low for recovery and struck the ice.It was determined that the aircraft was overweight by 1270 pounds (576 kg) when it departed Pelee Island. The maximum takeoff weight for this flight was 8550 pounds (3878 kg)."
188,ACC1559,"The Cessna Caravan was used for a pilot type endorsement training and departed Cairns at 15:37. Following some upper level air work, the crew requested, and were granted a clearance for, a simulated engine failure and descent to 2,000 ft. The pilot in command retarded the power lever to the flight idle stop and the fuel condition lever to the low idle range, setting a value of 55% engine gas generator speed (Ng). The pilot under training then set the glide attitude at the best glide speed of about 79 knots indicated airspeed and feather the propeller The PIC reported that he instructed the pilot under training to advance the emergency power lever (EPL) to simulate manual introduction of fuel to the engine. He then noticed that there was no engine torque increase, with the engine inter-turbine temperature (ITT or T5) and Ng rapidly decreasing, and a strong smell of fuel in the cockpit. Despite several efforts to relight the engine, they were not successful. They then completed a successful landing in a depth of about 2 m of water near Green Island. The aircraft sustained minor damage during the ditching, but subsequent substantial damage due to salt water immersion."

A right crosswind was estimated between 15 to 25 knots.  About 300 feet after beginning the takeoff roll, between 30 to 50 knots airspeed, the airplane began to drift to the left, which the pilot was unable to correct.  The airplane departed off the left side of the runway and nosed over.  The airplane received damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.  The maximum demonstrated crosswind velocity, takeoff or landing, is 20 knots."
190,ACC1561,"A Fokker 50 passenger plane, operated by Kish Air, was destroyed when it crashed near Sharjah Airport (SHJ), United Arab Emirates. All six crew members and 37 of the 40 passengers were killed.The aircraft was operating as a scheduled flight from Kish Island, Iran to Sharjah, UAE with the captain initially as the pilot flying (PF). During the cruise and just prior to descent, the captain unexpectedly handed over control of the aircraft to the First Officer prior to the approach to Sharjah. The first officer did not accept this willingly and stated that he was not confident of his ability to conduct a VOR/DME approach into Sharjah. This statement was not consistent with his previous experience and could indicate either a cultural or professional issue. The captain insisted the first officer fly the aircraft and encouraged and instructed him during the approach. At 11:24 hours local time, the aircraft contacted Dubai Arrivals and was cleared from 9000 ft to 5000 ft and instructed to expect a VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at Sharjah International Airport. At 11:29 hours the aircraft was further cleared to 2500 ft and cleared for the approach. The aircraft was under its own navigation and the daylight conditions were fine with excellent visibility. At 11:35 hours the aircraft was instructed to contact Sharjah Tower and the pilot reported that the aircraft was established on the VOR final approach for runway 12. The Tower cleared IRK7170 to land and advised that the wind was calm. At that point the aircraft was slightly above the approach profile. The initial speed for the approach was at least 50 kt high at approximately 190 kt with no flap and no landing gear. The aircraft should have been configured with landing gear down and flap 10° during the approach and stabilized at 130 kt prior to the MDA. Approaching the MDA at flight idle setting, the auto-pilot was disengaged and the first Officer called for flap 10 at 186 kt (limiting speed of 180 kt) and flap 25 was selected by the Captain, a setting uncalled for by the Pilot Flying at 183 kt (limiting speed of 160 kt), and the landing gear was called for and selected at approximately 185 kt (limiting speed of 170 kt). The captain then took control of the aircraft and shortly afterwards the ground range selectors were heard by Cockpit Voice Recorder to be lifted and the power levers moved from the flight idle stop into the ground control range. The left propeller then went to full reverse whilst the right propeller remained in positive pitch within the ground control range. The aircraft descended in an extreme nose low left bank attitude until impact. The aircraft crashed 2.6 nm from the runway onto an unprepared sandy area adjacent to a road and residential buildings. The aircraft broke apart on impact and a fire started immediately."

The company had had a great deal of experience with this type of operations, and had been carrying out parachute drops in Norway each summer for the last 9 years. On Friday morning, 16 July 2004, the weather conditions were good when the flights started. They first performed six routine drop flights. After stopping to fill up with fuel, normal preparations were made for the next flight with 20 parachutists who were to jump in two groups of 10.The seventh departure was carried out at time 13:05. The Commander asked for and was given clearance by the air traffic control service to climb to flight level FL150. The parachutists were then dropped from that altitude. The first drop of 10 parachutists was made on a southerly course above the airstrip, and the aircraft continued on that course for a short time before turning through 180° and getting ready for the next drop at the same location on a northerly course.A large cumulonimbus cloud (CB), with precipitation, had approached the airfield from the north at this time. To reach the drop zone above the runway, the aircraft had to fly close to this cloud. The aircraft was not equipped with weather radar. The last parachutists to leave the aircraft were in a tandem jump that was being filmed on video. The film showed that the parachutists became covered in a layer of white ice within 2-3 seconds of leaving the aircraft. The ice on the parachutists only thawed once they had descended to lower altitudes where the air temperature was above zero.Once the parachutists had jumped, the aircraft was positioned close to the CB cloud at a low cruising speed. They were exposed to moderate turbulence from the cloud. The Commander started a sudden 90° turn to the left while also reducing engine power to flight idle in order to avoid the CB cloud and return to Østre Æra to land.At this point, the First Officer observed that ice had formed on the front windshield, and he chose to switch on the anti-icing system. He did this without informing the commander. A few seconds later both engines stopped, and both propellers automatically adopted the feathered position.The pilots had not noticed any technical problems with the aircraft engines before they failed. During the descent, the first officer, on the commander's orders, carried out a series of start-up attempts with reference to the checklist/procedure they had available in the cockpit. The engines would not start and the commander made a decision and prepared to carry out an emergency landing at Østre Æra without engines.The runway at Østre Æra is 600 m long and 10 m wide. The surrounding area is covered by dense coniferous forest and they had no alternative landing areas within reach. Because they were without engine power, there was no hydraulic power to operate the aircraft's flaps. This meant that the speed of the aircraft had to be kept relatively high, approx. 160-180 km/h. The final approach was further complicated because the commander had to avoid the last 10 parachutists who were still in the air and who were steering towards a landing area just beside the airstrip.The commander first positioned the aircraft on downwind on a southerly course west of the airfield, in order then to make a left turn to final on runway 01. The landing took place around halfway down the runway, at a faster speed than normal - according to the Commander's explanation approximately 160-170 km/h. The commander braked using the wheel brakes, but when he realized that he would not be able to stop on the length of runway remaining, he ceased braking. He knew that the terrain directly on the extension to the runway was rough, and chose to use the aircraft's remaining speed to lift it off the ground and to alter course a little to the right. The aircraft passed over the approx. 2.5 m high embankment in the transition between the runway level and the higher marshy plateau surrounding the northern runway area.The aircraft ran approx. 230 m in ground effect before landing on its wheels in the flat marshy area north of the airfield. After around 60 m of roll-out, the nose wheel and the aircraft's nose struck a ditch and the aircraft turned over lengthways. It came to rest upside down with its nose section pointing towards the landing strip. The floor of the cockpit was pushed up so that the nose wheel came through the floor and partially into the cockpit."
210,ACC1581,"The CASA 212 landed at in stormy weather and could not be brought to a stop on the runway. It ran through the perimeter fence, crossed a dirt road and came to rest in a field."
211,ACC1582,"The Convair, owned by Air Tahoma, was carrying overnight delivery packages under contract to DHL Worldwide Express. The captain began fuel crossfeed operations about 50 minutes into the flight and allowed it to continue unmonitored for almost 30 minutes. During the crossfeed operations, the fuel tank shutoff valve had been left open. This is contrary to approved procedures and allowed fuel transfer from the left tank to the right tank. During the airplane's descent tolanding, the fuel in the left tank, which was providing fuel to both engines, was exhausted because both engine-driven fuel pumps drew air from the left tank into the fuel system instead of fuel from the right tank, which led to a dual engine flameout caused by fuel starvation. The airplane was approaching runway 36R at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport but did not make it to the runway. The aircraft crashed on the sixth hole at the World of Sports golf course, just south of the airport and broke up."
212,ACC1583,"The Grand Caravan collided with the Nyarigongo Volcano in bad weather, ten minutes after takeoff. It crashed into the 8,500 feet level of the 11,000 feet high volcano."
213,ACC1584,"DHC-3 N197TT was one of two aircraft that departed McGrath for Unalakleet and Kotzebue to transport hunting camp supplies. Instrument meteorological conditions consisting of mist, fog, and smoke, prevailed in the area of the accident. Because of this, the Otter flew about 500 to 1,000 feet above the ground. Suddenly a mountain ridge appeared in front of the airplane. The pilot banked the airplane to the left, and added engine power. A few seconds later the airplane touched trees and descended into the ground, coming to rest upright. The survivors spent two nights at the wreckage under heavy forest fire smoke and severe weather before they were spotted by rescue crews."
214,ACC1585,"Four Eritreans among a group being forcibly returned home from Libya hijacked their aircraft and forced it to land in Khartoum. At first the hijackers refused to surrender and forced the pilot to takeoff again. When being told that they were denied permission to land anywhere in Sudan and with a fuel reserve of one hour, the hijackers gave in. The C-130 Hercules was allowed to land again at Karthoum where the hijackers surrendered."
215,ACC1586,"A Learjet 25B, N47MR, operated by American Jets, Inc., was substantially damaged when both tires blew during the takeoff roll from Colorado Springs Municipal Airport (COS), Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The lifeguard flight was being operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The pilot, co-pilot, two crew members and a passenger reported no injuries.During the takeoff roll, the airplane began to vibrate on the right side and then the right tire blew. The left tire blew shortly thereafter. The captain maintained directional control and the drag chute was deployed. The airplane came to rest at the departure end of runway 17L. A postaccident investigation revealed that metal from the landing gear penetrated the wings and the fuselage was wrinkled. An examination of the airplane systems revealed no anomalies."
216,ACC1587,"The aircraft overran the wet Mobil Oil airstrip at Eket by over a thousand feet, and eventually missing the airstrip perimeter fence by some meters before coming to a stop."
217,ACC1588,"The crew of the Metro III executed an ILS approach for landing onto runway 11 at George Airport (GRJ). At 1000ft from the threshold of runway 11 with the undercarriage selected down and at full flaps for landing at an IAS of 120 kt when he advised the co-pilot (the flying pilot), to continue visually with the approach for runway 11. Shortly after afterwards they heard a loud impact sound and the right hand engine failed. The aircraft suddenly yawed and banked severely to the right and the flying pilot commented that they had experienced a bird strike on the right-hand engine. The pilot-in-command immediately took over the controls and attempted to arrest the yaw to the right but the aircraft kept yawing to the right. He called for a go around. The co-pilot then selected full power on both engines retracted the undercarriage, whilst the pilot-in-command feathered the right-hand propeller.According to the pilot-in-command, the aircraft continued to yaw to the right and with the stall aural warning sounding with a loss of altitude, he pulled the left-hand engine stop and feather control and was committed to execute a forced landing on a cattle farm. Both wings collided with the gum poles of a telephone and wire fence causing extensive damage to the wings and fuselage under-surface."
218,ACC1589,"The aircraft was landed in a crosswind on La Ronge's runway 18 and touched down firmly, approximately 1000 feet from the threshold. On touchdown, the left wing dropped and the propeller made contact with the runway. The aircraft veered to the left side of the runway, despite full rudder and aileron deflection. The crew applied maximum right braking and shut down both engines. The aircraft departed the runway and traveled approximately 200 feet through the infield before the nose and right main gear were torn rearwards; the left gear collapsed into the wheel well. The aircraft slid on its belly before coming to rest approximately 300 feet off the side of the runway. Three of the passengers suffered minor injuries from the sudden stop associated with the final collapsing."
219,ACC1590,"The Islander was transporting guests to and from a remote wilderness lodge. It took off from a beach in severe winds. About 20 feet agl, a strong gust of wind, or a downdraft, hit the airplane. The airplane descended and the left wing collided with the beach, which spun the airplane 180 degrees. The airplane came to rest in about 2 1/2 feet of water."
220,ACC1591,"The Bushmaster, a Ford Tri-Motor replica plane, took part in an air show during the Fullerton Airport Appreciation Day. As it was attempting to takeoff, it departed runway 24. The pilot pulled up to avoid ramp personnel. It just missed the control tower and slammed onto a street, sideswiping a car. The plane broke apart on impact and erupted in flames. A photograph of the airplane clearly showed a strap connecting the left elevator to the rudder."
221,ACC1592,"The Howard 250, a converted Lockheed L-18, was prepared for takeoff from Midland following the conclusion of the Fina-CAF AirSho. The aircraft was cleared for a runway 34L departure with winds at 160 deg. /10 kts. Shortly after starting the takeoff roll the airplane began to swerve to the right. Using the rudder the captain was able to correct back to the centerline. The airplane then swerved to the left and using full right rudder the captain reported that he could not arrest the left turn. By the time the airplane reached the left side of the runway, the airplane had not reached the V2 speed (minimum takeoff safety speed) of 110 knots. The airplane departed the left side of the runway, became airborne and shortly thereafter, the right wing dipped and contacted the ground. The airplane then spun 180 degrees, impacted the terrain, and slid backwards coming to rest in an upright position."
222,ACC1593,"The Antonov, piloted by four Russian crew members, reportedly left El Obeid around 11:35 for a flight to Juba. En route at FL170 the airplane is understood to have suffered engine problems. The crew decided to divert to Heglig. The aircraft crashed inverted in a wooded area, killing all aboard."
223,ACC1594,"At 00:03 local time MK Airlines flight 1602 departed Windsor Locks-Bradley International Airport (BDL) for a flight to Zaragoza, Spain with a cargo of lawn tractors. An intermediate stop was made at Halifax (YHZ), where the aircraft landed at 02:12 local time. At YHZ the aircraft was loaded with 53,000 kilograms of lobster and fish. After fueling, the total fuel load was 89 400 kg. The planned takeoff weight was 353 000 kg. The Boeing Laptop Tool (BLT) was then used to calculate the takeoff speeds. Since the software was last used before the takeoff from Bradley, it still contained those figures. The airport information and weather was changed to Halifax, but somehow the takeoff weight was not changed and remained showing 240.000 kg. Takeoff performance data were generated, resulting in incorrect V speeds and thrust setting being transcribed to the takeoff data card. It is most likely that the crew did not adhere to the operator's procedures for an independent check of the takeoff data card, so the erroneous figures went unnoticed.It was dark, but the weather was fine as the airplane was cleared to taxi to runway 24 (8800 ft / 2682 m long) for departure. After push back, the aircraft began to taxi, the flaps were extended to 20°, and the horizontal stabilizer was set to 6.1 trim units, where it remained for the duration of the flight. The flight control checks were completed during the taxi. The aircraft entered runway 24 at Taxiway Delta and backtracked to the threshold. The aircraft then made a 180° turn to the right and, upon lining up with the runway, the thrust levers were advanced and a rolling takeoff was commenced at 06:53:22.At the start of the takeoff roll, the thrust levers were smoothly advanced from ground idle thrust (approximately 1.0 EPR) to takeoff power with all final EPR settings indicating between 1.3 and 1.33. The aircraft accelerated through 80 KCAS (06:53:46) approximately 1800 feet (550 m) from the threshold.At 130 KCAS, the control column was moved aft to 8.4° to initiate rotation as the aircraft passed the 5500-foot (1680 m) mark of runway 24 (3300 feet / 1010 m of runway remaining). The aircraft began to rotate. The pitch attitude stabilized briefly at approximately 9° nose-up, with airspeed at 144 KCAS. Because the 747 still had not lifted off the runway, the control column was moved further aft to 10°, and the aircraft responded with a further pitch up to approximately 11°; initial contact of the lower aft fuselage with the runway occurred at this time. The aircraft was approximately at the 8000-foot (2450 m) mark and slightly left of the centreline. The control column was then relaxed slightly, to 9° aft. The pitch attitude stabilized in the 11° range for the next four seconds, and the lower aft fuselage contact with the runway ended briefly. With approximately 600 feet (185 m) of runway remaining, the thrust levers were advanced to 92 per cent and the EPRs increased to 1.60. With 420 feet (130 m) remaining, the lower aft fuselage contacted the runway a second time. As the aircraft passed the end of the runway, the control column was 13.5° aft, pitch attitude was 11.9° nose-up, and airspeed was 152 KCAS. The highest recorded nose-up pitch of 14.5° (06:54:24) was recorded after the aircraft passed the end of the runway at a speed of 155 KCAS. The aircraft became airborne approximately 670 feet (205 m) beyond the paved surface and flew a distance of 325 feet (100 m). The lower aft fuselage then struck an earthen berm supporting an instrument landing system (ILS) localizer antenna. The aircraft's tail separated on impact, and the rest of the aircraft continued in the air for another 1200 feet (370 m) before it struck terrain and burst into flames."

225,ACC1596,"Cessna 208B Grand Caravan 5H-AXL was operating a charter flight to transport tourists from Arusha to Ruaha, Tanzania. It was carrying one pilot and nine passengers. The takeoff, climb out and the initial phase of the flight were normal. About 20 minutes into the flight at FL125 (12500 feet amsl) when the pilot had already made a power reduction and was in the process of trimming the aircraft for level flight, a loud bang was heard that was accompanied by a loss of engine power. The pilot immediately switched on the ignition to no avail. He set the power lever to IDLE, at the same time checking the Ng, which read 0%. The indications from other instruments and the annunciator panel showed that the engine was not running. Efforts to restart the engine failed and the pilot took advantage of the high altitude to circle around in order to find a convenient field for executing a forced landing.The pilot subsequently located a Masai steppe overlooking Loiborsoit village in Simanjiro. After briefing the passengers about the imminent forced landing the pilot made a touch down on a grass field. After rolling for about 400 meters 5H-AXL ran into a terraced field from which maize had been harvested. Tire marks on the ground indicated that it was here that the nose landing gear struck raised lip of earth and sheared from its fuselage attachment point. It subsequently penetrated into the forward baggage pod compartment.The aircraft came to rest some 480 meters beyond the point of initial touch down. The pilot opened the cockpit door and all passengers disembarked safely. There was no fire and there were no injuries. The aircraft sustained damage to its nose landing gear which separated and the propeller, whose two blades were bent. One of the tubular members of the engine bearer frame was bent and the baggage pod was damaged when it scraped the ground."
226,ACC1597,"A Reims Cessna F406 Caravan II, G-TWIG, operated by Highland Airways, was destroyed when it collided with mountainous terrain northwest of Inverness, U.K. The pilot was killed.The airplane departed Stornoway Airport (SYY) at 10:15 on a positioning flight to Inverness Airport (INV). At 10:29 the pilot was cleared to descend from FL95 to FL75. Three minutes later radar contact was lost.The aircraft wreckage was found by a mountain rescue team the following day at 13:30. It was located at an elevation of 2,480 ft amsl on Meall Feith na Slataich, a broad mountain ridge in a remote area of the Scottish Highlands."
227,ACC1598,"Southern Air Charter Flight 204 departed Arthur's Town Airport on Cat Island, Bahamas and the airplane climbed to 8500 feet. During cruise flight approximately 28 miles from the destination airport, the right engine lost 60 percent power. The engine remained in that state for approximately 3-5 minutes, then the fuel pressure annunciation light illuminated. The right standby fuel pump was activated, the flight continued, and when the flight was approximately 18-19 miles from the destination airport while flying at 5,500 feet, the right engine quit. The right propeller was feathered and the engine was shut down, and air traffic control cleared the flight for a straight in approach to runway 27 at the destination airport. The flight continued and while flying between 3,000 and 3,500 feet, the left engine began similar indications; however, the left engine power decreased to between 30 and 40 percent. Unable to land at the destination airport, the airplane was ditched 80 yards off the southern shoreline of New Providence Island and all occupants evacuated the airplane.Investigation revealed that the right engine stopped from fuel exhaustion."
228,ACC1599,"The aircraft was being taxied from the dispersal to the holding point in preparation for departure for a local flight when the pilot heard two loud bangs from the area of the nose wheel. The pilot contacted ATC on the radio and requested them to look for damage or anything abnormal. ATC reported that a panel appeared to be loose so the pilot returned the aircraft to dispersal andshut down the engine.Examination by the operators aircraft engineer found that the rear support of the nose landing gear (NLG) spring had come away from its rear fuselage mounting point and had dislodged the composite fairing that was fitted immediately below the spring and its supports.Examination of the four bolts that attach the NLG rear spring support to the fuselage has shown that one bolt failed due to fatigue and the remaining three were pulled from their anchor nuts causing the bolt threads to strip. The fatigue crack initiated at multiple origins in the end thread at one side of the bolt indicating that it was due to bending fatigue.From the geometry of the NLG it can be seen that towing the aircraft by the nose wheel increases the forward load on the NLG rear spring support. A sudden start, jerk or attempt to start towing with the parking brake on or wheel chocks in place could substantially increase the forward loads on the rear support attachment bolts. Therefore, any of these reasons could be the cause of the forward hole elongation seen in the fuselage structure."
229,ACC1600,"The Let L-410 aircraft was on a base training flight at Kilimanjaro International Airport. At 04:10 UTC it was cleared to the local flying area for upper air works, followed by VOR/ILS approaches to runway 09 via NDB KB. 5H-PAC took off and proceeded to the local flying area where the crew members did upper air works for about 30 minutes. According to the commander, these included clean and dirty stalls, level flights at different speeds, 45 degree turns left and right and exercises on unusual attitudes. Subsequent to these they returned to the airport via NDB KB for ILS approach to runway 09. They carried out a missed approach and proceeded to join right hand circuits for touch-and-go operations on runway 09. The last operations before the accident was simulated engine failure after take off followed by single engine overshoot, this time using runway 27.This was approved and the commander was reminded that the surface wind was 090 degrees 08 knots. The aircraft turned left and positioned on right base for runway 27. It was subsequently given a landing clearance. The controller, who was handling the flight, said that the final approach was perfect. The landing gear was down. The aircraft passed the threshold of runway 27 at about 70 feet above the ground and continued to flare on a straight and level attitude with the landing gear retracted. It continued in this attitude for a distance of about one and a half kilometers down the runway subsequent to which it drifted off the runway to the right. The controller asked the pilot to explain his intentions. There was no reply. Instead, the aircraft was observed to yaw violently as it drifted further to the right. Moments later, it impacted the ground on a grass hedge and skidded along the width of taxiway Y before it came to rest. The commander said that he took the controls immediately when the aircraft started yawing but there was no time effect recovery.There was fuel spillage but fire did not break out. The two pilots, who had not put on their shoulder straps, sustained facial injuries."
230,ACC1601,The Twin Otter departed the dirt runway of the Menzel Lejmat North oil field near Hassi Messaoud. This caused severe damage to wing and propeller.

At 12:15 hours the aircraft taxied from the apron to the threshold of runway 27 at which point take off for Seronera was initiated.The controller, who was handling the flight, said that the initial segment of the take off roll was normal. When the aircraft had covered about 500 metres he saw the left main landing gear collapsing and the aircraft swinging to the left of the runway. It continued to run on its belly pod on a grass hedge parallel to runway 27 and came to rest at the eastern edge of the apron.There was no fire and all the occupants deplaned without injuries. The aircraft sustained damage to propellers, the right wing, the fuselage and underside structure. The cargo pod in the belly was completely destroyed and its debris was scattered along the wreckage trail."
232,ACC1603,"A Beechcraft B200 Super King Air twin-engine turboprop airplane, N6PE, was substantially damaged during a forced landing following a dual loss of engine power approximately four miles (6,5 km) north of runway 18L at Tulsa International Airport (TUL), near Tulsa, Oklahoma. The instrument-rated private pilot, sole occupant and owner of the airplane, sustained minor injuries.The 2,100-hour instrument-rated private pilot stated that prior to departure for a 507 nautical-mile cross-country flight, the fuel gauges indicated approximately 800 pounds of fuel on each side for a total of 1600 pounds; however, he did not visually check the amount of fuel that the tanks contained. During his approach to the destination airport, the right engine started to ""sputter"" before it finally quit. The pilot then ""looked over at the fuel gauges and both tanks were showing empty."" The left engine quit just a few moments later. The auto ignition installed in the airplane attempted to restart the engines. The engines restarted momentarily and then shut-off once more. The pilot declared an emergency and executed a forced landing onto a street below. After a hard landing onto the street, the right wing hit a telephone pole, and the left wing then hit several tree limbs before the airplane impacted a hill and came to a stop. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who responded to the accident site, found the fuel transfer switch in the ""right-crossfeed"" position. The fuel system was examined and no leaks or anomalies were found. Approximately three-quarters of a gallon of unusable fuel was found in the right engine nacelle. Approximately four gallons (28 pounds) of usable fuel was found in the left engine nacelle."
233,ACC1604,"The DC-3 departed Barrancominas (NBB) on a domestic flight to Villavicencio (VVC). En route near Río Manacacias at an altitude of 10.500 feet the aircraft experienced engine vibrations. The pilot reduced power on the right hand engine and decided to divert to Puerto Gaitán. The approach was normal but the airplane was not able to come stop on the remaining runway length. He swung the airplane 180 degrees, which caused the right hand undercarriage leg to collapse."
234,ACC1605,"At 11:13 the Citation airplane was cleared for the GPS runway 17 instrument approach into Ainsworth. The airplane started to accumulate ice around 4,000 feet msl during the approach. As the plane descended out of IMC between 300 and 400 feet agl the cockpit windows were obscured by the accumulation of ice and the pilot elected to land the airplane instead of executing the published missed-approach procedure. On finals the Cessna contacted terrain about 439 feet south of the departure end of runway 17. The aircraft traveled north about 18 feet prior to contacting an airport access road. The aircraft then became airborne and touched down for the second time after traveling north about 54 feet.

236,ACC1607,"The AirNow flight departed Bangor at 20:18 on a flight to Manchester. Weather at Manchester however was foggy and the pilot was unable to land there. The pilot then requested to proceed to his alternate destination, Burlington. During the flight to Burlington, the pilot was contacted by company dispatch and it was agreed that Bennington would be a better destination because it was 45 miles closer than Burlington. As the flight progressed towards Bennington, the pilot contacted ATC and requested to change his destination to Keene. Weather at Keene included winds from 350 degrees at 3 knots; 1 statute mile of visibility; an overcast cloud layer at 100 feet agl. The Bandeirante flew an ILS approach to runway 02. When the airplane broke out of the clouds, it was not stable. Approaching the runway, at full flaps and exceeding the 25 percent maximum for a go-around, the pilot added full power to the left engine. The high power setting, slow airspeed, and full flaps combination resulted in a minimum control speed (Vmc) roll. No determination could be made as to why the right engine was inoperative, and there were no mechanical or fuel-related anomalies found that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane came to rest inverted on runway 02, about 90 feet from the approach end."
237,ACC1608,"A Beech B200 Super King Air aircraft, registered VH-SGT, sustained damage when its main landing gear collapsed on touch down on runway 24 at Perth Airport, Australia. The aircraft had earlier departed the aerodrome on a charter flight with one pilot and seven passengers on board.The pilot had elected to return to the airport after detecting a problem during the retraction of the aircraft's landing gear. He attempted to manually extend the landing gear, but was unable to confirm that the landing gear had locked in position for the subsequent precautionary landing. The main landing gear collapsed as the aircraft touched down.Examination of the aircraft landing gear by the aircraft operator revealed an incorrectly installed thrust bearing in the hydraulic actuator for the left main landing gear. The result was that the axial loads normally carried by the thrust bearing were transferred to the actuator's pinion gears which fractured under abnormal operational loads. That damage seized the actuator and prevented the manual extension of the aircraft's landing gear by the pilot."
238,ACC1609,"The aircraft, leased by the French NGO Solidarités for a humanitarian flight, departed Goma on a flight to Kongolo via Bukavu and Kindu. It crashed into houses while on approach to Kongolo, some 100 meters short of the runway. At least ten persons were on board. The leasing contract stipulated that the flight was exclusively a cargo flight and was not authorized to transport any passengers.The airplane involved in the accident was grounded twice in 2004, once after a near crash due to engine failure. On both occasions, provincial authorities provided special dispensation and cleared the aircraft for immediate use."
239,ACC1610,"The Boeing 747 operated on a cargo flight from Dubai to Düsseldorf on behalf of Emirates. The en route part of the flight was uneventful.The flight crew established radio contact with Düsseldorf Radar at 05:43. The crew were told that runway 23L was in use. Two minutes later the radar controller contacted flight 8995: ""I just talked to the tower and ah for the time being braking action on all parts of the runway is supposed to be good. They are measuring again right now because it started to snow again and I'll keep you advised."" The flight was then cleared to descend to FL80. The flight crew decided to set the autobrakes for landing on Medium, to account for the snow.At 05:50 the radar controller again contacted the flight about the current weather circumstances: ""...latest update on the weather situation ahm the friction tester has reported braking action to be good for the moment however as its continuing to snow they are ah afraid that it might worsen, so they are going to do another friction test right before you land.""In the following minutes the flight was given descent instructions and vectors for an approach to runway 23L.At 05:54 the controller radioed: ""weather update we now have a surface wind of three four zero degrees eleven knots, that's slight tail wind component by two knots. Visibility is down to one thousand five hundred meters, still in snow showers and ah cloud base is now five hundred feet only.""The flight was subsequently cleared for the approach.At 05:57 the radar controller instructed the crew to contact Düsseldorf Tower. The Tower controller stated: ""Good morning,... we are just waiting for the braking action values from the friction tester stand by a second. The surface wind is actually three three zero degrees one two knots.""Two minutes later the controller radioed: ""... the braking action was measured to be medium at all parts. And ah the visibility dropped right now due to the heavy snow showers at the field ah. The RVR value at the touch down zone is presently nine hundred meters, at the mid-point one thousand one hundred meters and ah stop end one thousand one hundred meters."" At that moment the flight was 3,5 nautical miles out. The flight was subsequently cleared to land.The airplane touched down about 1700 ft (518 m) past the runway threshold. Ground spoilers and thrust reversers deployed and the autobrakes activated. Still the airplane did not decelerate as expected and the pilot applied manual braking. The airplane failed to stop and overran the runway end. It collided with ILS aerials, which caused a fire in engines no. 2 and no. 3.The aircraft was withdrawn from use at Düsseldorf until being scrapped there in April 2006."

241,ACC1612,"The Learjet 35A was operated as a positioning flight to Kansas City International Airport (MCI). Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was en route to MCI to pick up passengers and continue on as an on-demand charter but diverted to the Kansas City-Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport (MKC) following the closure of MCI. MCI was closed due to a McDonnell Douglas MD83 sliding off a taxiway during an after landing taxi on contaminated runway/taxiway conditions. MKC held a limited airport certificate that did not have a snow removal plan and was served by runway 19 (7,002 feet by 150 feet, grooved asphalt). Following a precision approach and landing on runway 19 at MKC, the Learjet 35A slid off the departure end of the runway and impacted airport property and terrain. The Learjet 35A was operated with inoperative thrust reversers as per the airplane's minimum equipment list at the time of the accident. About 1:05 hours before the accident, runway 19 Tapley values were recorded as 21-22-22 with 1/2 inch of wet snow. About 17 minutes before the accident, MKC began snow removal operations. About 7 minutes before the accident, the MKC air traffic control tower (TWR) instructed the snow removal vehicles to clear the runway for inbound traffic. TWR was advised by airport personnel that runway 19 was plowed and surface conditions were 1/4 inch of snow of snow; friction values were not taken or reported. While inbound, the Learjet 35A requested any braking action reports from TWR. The first airplane to land was a Cessna 210 Centurion, and the pilot reported braking action to the TWR as ""moderate"", which was then transmitted by TWR as ""fair"" from a Centurion in response to the Learjet 35A's query. The Cessna 210 Centurion pilot did not use brakes during landing and did not indicate this to TWR during his braking action report."

250,ACC1621,"The Antonov 12 cargo plane swerved off the runway at Kabul Airport. A tyre had burst on landing, causing the plane to run off the side of the runway. A small fire erupted near the undercarriage, but was quickly contained. Five of the six crew members were slightly injured."
251,ACC1622,"Widerøe flight WIF 921 took off from Tromsø airport (TOS) at 14:01 with an estimated landing time at Hammerfest Airport (HFT) of 14:42. On board the aircraft, a DHC-8-103 with registration LN-WIK, were a crew of two pilots and one cabin attendant, 26 passengers and one passive cabin attendant. During the approach to Hammerfest the crew was informed about variable and occasional gusty wind from south-east. The wind direction favoured runway 23 and the crew planned the landing accordingly. The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF). The copilot was newly hired and was flying under supervision. The crew was kept updated on the wind conditions by the AFIS operator, and at times the gusty wind conditions favoured runway 05. The copilot left the control to the commander who continued the approach to runway 05. Just before landing the wind direction veered to the right and increased in strength, resulting in a significant tail wind component. This resulted in a marked increase in the descent rate which the commander tried to stop by advancing to full power. However, the altitude was too low and the airplane touched down hard just inside the runway edge on runway 05. At touch down the right main landing gear leg failed. The airplane slid on the belly, right partly retracted main wheel and wing tip for some 650 m, and stopped just after the second (TWY B) turnoff to the apron. The fire and rescue vehicles were quickly at the scene and sprayed foam on the plane to prevent fire. The cabin attendant calmed the passengers who wanted to get out of the plane quickly due to smoke and burned smell in the cabin. It took 33 seconds from the commander's order to evacuate until this was actually initiated. The delay was mainly caused by the fact that the order did not get through the cabins Public Address (PA) system.The investigations show that Widerøe permitted landings in up to the maximum demonstrated cross wind component of 36 kt and in up to 10 kt tail wind during short field operations."

All 17 passengers and two crew members survived. The airplane operated on a charter flight from Rotterdam Airport (RTM) to Birmingham International Airport (BHX).The aircraft taxied to the beginning of runway 24 and lined up for takeoff. During line-up, the speed levers for the engines were moved from taxi position to flight position. The nose wheel steering fault indicator lit up and the first officer, who was steering the aircraft, responded by saying that he had no nose wheel steering. The captain informed the first officer that he had forgotten to press the switch on the throttles, which activates the nose wheel steering system. The first officer then confirmed that he had nose wheel steering.The aircraft almost immediately began moving towards the left hand side of the runway. The first officer tried to use the brakes and the directional rudder to return the aircraft to the centre of the runway. The aircraft had a speed of between 50 and 60 knots at that point. The crew rejected the takeoff but could not prevent the aircraft ending up alongside the runway, on the left hand side.The grass area alongside the runway is lower than the runway and the ground was soft. The left landing gear sank in the soft ground first and, as a result, the aircraft decelerated heavily and the left landing gear broke off almost immediately. The tip of the left wing struck the ground. This caused a ground loop effect and turned the aircraft further left. As a consequence the right landing gear and the nose gear also broke off. Once the aircraft had come to a standstill, the captain switched off all onboard systems and cut off the fuel supply to the engines. Simultaneously, the first officer was given the task of evacuating the passengers. The passengers were calm and left the aircraft without problems via the left hand door at the front of the aircraft. A moment later, the airport fire service arrived at the location of the accident. There was severe damage despite the relatively slow speed at which the aircraft left the runway."

Upon landing, the left float separated from the airplane, and the airplane subsequently sank. The occupants were rescued by a fisherman."
273,ACC1644,"The Antonov 2 was prepared for a flight from Sangar to Sebyan and Kyuel in Siberia. Because of poor weather the flight was delayed a couple of hours. The flight crew members repeatedly visited the meteorological office. At the time of the planned departure weather at Sangar was reported as: visibility more than 10 km, scattered clouds at 800 m, overcast at 3000 m, temperature -22° C, dewpoint -23° C, pressure 765 mm Hg. Weather forecast en route included a few stratocumulus clouds between 1400 and 1700 m, significant altostratus clouds between 2700 and 3500 m. The mountainous area over which the Antonov was to fly moderate orographical turbulence was present in the layer from 900 to 1700 meter, and possible downdrafts on the lee side of ridge in the same altitude range. These conditions were not reported to the crew. Then medical equipment with a weight of 400 kg and passengers arrived at the airport by ambulances. The captain expected seven passengers, but three additional passengers had arrived, without having tickets. The names were added to the passenger list and the copilot arranged the payment of the fare. No seats were available for two passengers, so they had to sit on some hand luggage in the aisle. At 04:46 UTC the aircraft departed from Sangar and climbed towards the mountainous terrain. The highest point along the route was at an elevation of 1976 m. The minimum safe altitude was 2515 m. The pilot climbed VFR and maintained visual separation from the snow-covered mountains. At an altitude of 1300 m the Antonov entered an area with strong turbulence. The aircraft was caught in a downdraft. In an attempt to stop the plane from descending further, power was added to nominal, then to the takeoff power. With rising terrain it was impossible to continue. The pilot decided to carry out a 180-degree turn to the left over downsloping terrain. This brought the plane downwind with a 30-degree bank instead of the recommended 20 degrees. As a result, the vertical rate of descent increased. Having rolled through 120 degrees, the left lower wing contacted a cliff. The aircraft lost speed and crash-landed on the mountain slope."

Also, the wrong flap setting was used. On final approach to runway 32, the airplane descended below the normal glidepath. The C-5 stalled , hit a utility pole and crashed into a field. The tail separated and the C-5 crash-landed further on. The nose section separated due to the impact.The airplane's flight deck was salvaged and flown to Macon-Robins AFB, GA (WRB) in August 2006 to be used as a modernized C-5 software simulator."
288,ACC1659,"The pilot was performing the 12th flight of the day spraying crops. Before the 12th takeoff the pilot allowed to two unauthorized persons to go on board, an 11-year old boy, who occupied a right seat, and a 22-year old man, who was standing behind the seats. Takeoff was performed at 14:51. During the left turn at a speed of 140-150 km/h the An-2 descended from altitude of 5-10 m, struck the ground, left lower wing first, crashed and was destroyed by fire. Both adult men were killed while the boy suffered the serious injures."

The airplane reportedly landed at Haydom in severe weather, coming to rest in a sisal plantation field. The airplane suffered substantial damage to both wings, propeller, front cowling, baggage pod and fuselage."
290,ACC1661,Armavia flight 967 departed Yerevan (EVN) at 00:47 on a scheduled flight to Sochi (AER). Weather at Sochi was poor with rain and poor visibility. Radio contact with Sochi was established at 01:10. The flight crew discussed the current weather conditions at Sochi with the approach controller. At 01:26 the crew decided to return to Yerevan due to the below minima weather conditions at Sochi. At 01:30 the crew again requested the latest weather information. Visibility now was reported as 3600 m with a cloud base at 170 m. The captain now decided to continue to Sochi instead. Clearance was give to descent to an altitude of 3600 m. At 02:00 further descent instructions for 1800 m were issued by the air traffic controller. Weather conditions for an approach to runway 06 were now equal to the airport minima. Sochi Tower then cleared the flight to descend to 600 m. The glideslope was captured and the gear was lowered at 02:10. The crew reported ready and where cleared for landing. Weather was reported as 4000 m visibility with a cloud base at 190 m. Weather deteriorated quickly and thirty seconds later the controller reported that the cloud base was now at 100 m. He instructed the flight to abort the approach and told the crew to make a climbing right hand turn to an altitude of 600 m. The aircraft was flying at 300 m and performed a climbing turn to 450 m. Simultaneously the groundspeed dropped and the Airbus descended until it contacted the water and broke up. Wreckage sank to a depth of 700 m.
291,ACC1662,"The accident aircraft, a Convair 580A, was one of two aircraft that had recently been delivered to the Government of Saskatchewan's Northern Air Operations. CV-580As had been converted to aerial tankers (water bombers) for fighting forest fires. The accident flight was a training flight that consisted of stop-and-go circuits at the La Ronge Airport (YVC). The purpose of the training was to instruct and cross-qualify new CV-580A captains as first officers for future training requirements. The first two circuits were unremarkable; all altitudes, speeds, and aircraft performance were as expected for the exercises being carried out.The final approach leg of the third circuit differed from the first two in that the aircraft's speed was lower. The airspeed was stabilized at 103 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). The rate of descent and respective altitudes were unstable compared with those of the first two circuits. The captain had called for a power setting of 150 to 200 hp on both engines on short final approach, and the flaps, which had been set at 24°, were selected to 28°. The aircraft entered a high sink rate of approximately 1280 feet per minute.In an effort to arrest the high sink rate, the captain, who was the pilot flying, called for increased power, briefly increased pitch attitude, and then touched down on the runway, approximately 200 feet beyond the threshold. The first officer, the pilot not flying, responded to the captain's call for power by rapidly advancing both power levers to a point beyond the maximum power setting limit. When the power levers were advanced, the left propeller immediately autofeathered and the left engine shut down. The captain, noting the position of the power levers, quickly retarded them to a position he assumed would give maximum power.During the final approach leg and on the go-around, the captain was not continuously setting or monitoring the engine power settings and consequently was unaware of the engine power or the nature of the emergency. The elapsed time between encountering the high sink rate and initiating the go-around was approximately seven seconds.After touching down on the runway, the captain, believing that the aircraft was not aligned with the runway, initiated a go-around. The autofeather was not called out or identified as an emergency. The decision to go around was not called out or communicated to the first officer. The go-around was commenced at an airspeed of approximately 94 KIAS (V1 minus 2)1. The gear was then selected up during a momentary positive rate of climb and the flaps were retracted at an airspeed of 95 KIAS, after the aircraft cleared the VOR radio range transmitter located left of the departure end of runway 36.Shortly after the aircraft became airborne, its left wing dropped slightly and could not be righted. The airspeed fluctuated between 93 and 98 KIAS and would not increase with a positive pitch angle. Once the flaps were retracted at 95 KIAS, the angle of bank increased uncontrollably. The aircraft started to descend, and collided with trees and terrain in a wooded area on the airport property."

293,ACC1664,"The RAF Hercules was on a routine operational flight providing support to the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) at Lashkar Gar, Afghanistan at the time of the accident. The LKG Tactical Landing Zone (TLZ) is 6800ft long by 150ft wide with a surface of compacted sand and gravel located on the south side of LKG town. The TLZ is used by UK forces and other agencies including the UN and Red Cross.The aircraft took off at 08:50 UTC from Kabul International Airport (KBL) to fly a routine logistics sortie to deliver cargo and personnel to LKG TLZ. After an uneventful medium level transit the aircraft landed at LKG at 10:20 UTC. Using a standard tactical landing technique the aircraft touched down some 500ft in from the runway threshold, reverse thrust was selected and speed reduced without the need for wheel braking.After 3 seconds, as the speed was nearing 70 kts there was a loud bang from the port side of the aircraft in the vicinity of the port main landing gear, the force of which was felt throughout the aircraft. At the same time the flight deck crew saw tyre debris flying up in front of the aircraft and then became aware of structural damage to the number 2 engine. The captain ordered the Emergency Engine Shutdown Drill (EESD) on the number 2 engine. He maintained directional control with nosewheel steering. Immediately after the shutdown of number 2 engine crew members observed a large amount of fuel leaking from the port wing area in the vicinity of the external tank pylon and that there was a fire in the vicinity of No.1 engine. The captain ordered the shut down of the No.1 engine using the EESD. Whilst this drill was carried out crew members observed that the fire was spreading across the whole wing. Realising the severity of the situation the captain brought the aircraft to a halt near the northern end of the landing zone some 6400ft from the touchdown point. He ordered the passengers and crew to immediately carry out the Emergency Evacuation Drill.Once all personnel had evacuated the aircraft, fire rapidly destroyed the aircraft and cargo."
294,ACC1665,"The DC-10 cargo plane landed on runway 09 (8012 feet/2450 m long) but failed to stop. It overran the runway by approx 1140 ft (350 m) and came to rest after it had ran across the perimeter fence. The nosegear collapsed, causing substantial damage to the forward fuselage. A left wing fuel leak was quickly contained by the fire services. The aircraft also suffered substantial damage to the no. 1 and 3 engines."

297,ACC1668,"Servicing remote airports in Nepal, the Yeti Airlines Twin Otter departed Nepalganj (KEP) for a flight to Jumla (JUM) via Surkhet (SKH). The flight took off from Surket at 11:35 with 6 passengers, 941 kg of cargo including food grains and three crew members on board. The total take off weight of aircraft was 12,499 lb (5669 kg) which included 1400 lb (635 kg)  of fuel.The weather report at Jumla at that time was fair with bright sunshine and north easterly 02 knots wind. The wind direction had changed at the time of take off from south westerly.The aircraft left Surkhet valley and established contact with Nepalgunj Tower as per normal procedure. At 11:49 the aircraft reported 'Virgin Pass', one of the reporting points en-route to Jumla.At 11:55 the aircraft established contact with Jumla Information and received weather information and runway 27 for landing. Wind was reported being 240 at 4 kts. The pilot decided to use runway 09 and reported turning final at 12:01. The aircraft appeared on final approach with high speed. The captain carried out missed approach without informing Jumla control tower. He coordinated his position and intention to use runway 27 with the pilot of aircraft 9N-AHR operated by Sita Air which was to land 7 minutes behind him. The captain flew over to the right of Jumla control tower, while executing the missed approach and headed towards a hill. The captain then made a sharp left turn with a high bank angle with an intention to land on runway 27 while informing to vacate the runway for trailing 9N-AHR aircraft. During this process the aircraft lost speed as well as altitude considerably and hit the paddy field to the east of the airport. The Twin Otter bounced up and traversed a further 200 feet approximately or so ultimately hitting a terrace, cart wheeled came to rest turning 180 degrees with tail section twisted. It instantly caught fire."

The no. 4 propeller separated and the aircraft went off the side of the runway.The aircraft also received extensive damage to the underside of the fuselage."
299,ACC1670,"Yeti Airlines Twin Otter 9N-AFE took off at 12:43 from Nepalgunj (KEP) bound for Bajura Airport (BJU) located in far western Nepal. It carried 1350 kg of rice. After reporting 20 miles at 8500 ft to Nepalgunj tower the flight was then instructed to report Virgin pass, a compulsory reporting point en-route to Bajura and other far western airports. The Nepalgunj tower also provided 9N-AFE with wind information at Bajura as westerly ranging from 10 to 15 knots.Another Yeti Airlines aircraft 9N-AEV also had taken off from Nepalgunj after 9N-AFE and was in contact with 9N-AFE over radio. The crew of 9N-AEV radioed that it had communicated with Bajura and had been informed that the wind speed had increased with a gusting tendency and could reach 20 knots.At 13:02, 9N-AEV had reached 30 DME from Nepalgunj and radioed AFE that wind at Bajura had increased to 18 knots and stated that they would divert back to Nepalgunj.At 13:04 9N-AFE established radio contact with Bajura tower and received the latest wind information as- ""wind continuously westerly at 08/18 knots."" The pilot then contacted Bajura and stated that they had arrived west of Virgin Pass and were about to enter the valley. This communication was repeated a couple of times as it was notintelligible to Bajura over HF radio. At 13:08 Bajura reported the latest wind information as 25 knots.The crew subsequently reported entering valley at 5000 ft and were given the wind then as 18 knots and instructed to report final. At 13:18 9N-AFE was given wind information as 18 knots and told that the runway was clear. On finals the aircraft's left main landing gear struck the 4 ft high barbed fencing and tore along some length of the barbed wires and simultaneously bounced off the edge of a culvert inside the fencing with a slight left bank and glided to a stop about 900 feet from the threshold."

302,ACC1673,"A Fokker F-27 Friendship 200 passenger plane, registered AP-BAL, was destroyed in an accident shortly after takeoff from Multan Airport (MUX), Pakistan. All 41 passengers and four crew members were killed.Pakistan International Airlines flight PK-688 was a scheduled service from Multan to Lahore Airport (LHE), Pakistan.During the roll for take off on runway 36 at a speed of about 60-70 kts, an unidentified pump was observed to be malfunctioning about which the aircrew showed their concern.Subsequently the aircraft started to veer to the right side but the captain was able to straighten it to the runway direction in the right half of the runway. At a speed of about 90 kts, the captain asked his co-pilot if the right engine torque was less, which was confirmed by the co-pilot.After another 5 seconds, the co-pilot announced the V1 speed (around 108-110 kts). The aircraft lifted off at a speed of 120 kts, which was above the scheduled Vr.Some 44 seconds after initiation of the take off roll, the right engine flamed out (spooled down) and the prop auto feathered. The gear was not raised and the crew started securing the engine below an altitude of 400 feet, which was contrary to emergency procedures. Meanwhile the airplane was drifting to the right. Because the gears were not raised and the aircraft was not wings level, the speed started to decrease. Consequently the aircraft stopped climbing at 150-160 feet AGL. Some 40 seconds after takeoff the aircraft stalled and crashed. A fire erupted."
303,ACC1674,"In the morning, the aircraft departed from Antalya (LTAI) in Turkey, as flight OHY601, with 146 passengers and seven crew members on board. During the VOR-DME approach for runway 06 at Rotterdam Airport, the aircraft was controlled manually and the thrust was determined by the automatic throttle control system ('auto thrust system'). At 09.47 hours local time the aircraft landed before the beginning of the runway. During this landing the tail of the aircraft hit the ground, causing considerable damage to the tail section.The captain, who was also the pilot flying, stated that the aircraft lost speed and altitude during the last part of the approach. He reacted to this by having the aircraft adopt a higher pitch attitude. According to him the auto thrust system would have had to deliver more power due to the higher pitch. He stated that he did not notice the desired reaction by the auto thrust system because he was looking outside at that moment. It is not clear if and how the first officer checked the instruments during this phase of the flight. He did not intervene nor did he point out the speed drop to the captain.`"
304,ACC1675,"FedEx flight 630 departed Seattle (SEA) at 05:58 PDT for a cargo flight to Memphis (MEM). Approaching Memphis, air traffic control vectored the flight onto the runway 18R final approach course. The flight was then cleared for a visual approach to runway 18R. The visual approach was initially flown with the autopilot engaged and coupled to the ILS. The airplane was established on the final approach course about 9 miles north of the airport. About 1,600 feet altitude, the airplane was configured for a flaps 35 landing and the approach was stable passing through 1,000 feet. The crew reported that gusty winds at altitude reduced to near calm, or a light tailwind, by this point.The crew reported the final approach segment was smooth, and the first officer disengaged the autopilot at approximately 400 feet and manually flew the airplane appropriate to conditions. He noted that some crosswind correction was still required at approximately 50 feet, when the electronic altitude callout cadence began. He stated that the flare and touchdown were normal, with crosswind correction. The airplane landed with 122 knots airspeed and a descent rate of approximately 2 to 3 feet per second. The touchdown was within design limits for the main landing gear.Approximately seven seconds after touchdown, the left hand main landing gear began to fail (collapse). The first officer reported that while actuating the thrust reversers, he started to apply brakes and immediately experienced ""a severe and violent shudder"" much more violent than he had ever experienced. He released the brakes, and the shuddering continued, but less violently, and he then reapplied brakes and the shuddering increased again. At that time, the airplane rolled and yawed to the left. The first officer held full right yoke and full right rudder in an effort to counter the turning and listing. The captain tried to assist by using the tiller to keep the airplane on the runway. The airplane continued yawing and sliding to the left and came to rest close to taxiway M4.Prior to the airplane stopping, a fire ignited beneath the left engine nacelle and spread to the inner portion of the left wing. The captain activated the left engine fire extinguisher and began shutting down the airplane. Airport fire crews responded almost immediately, and the fire was extinguished prior to spreading further.The crew and nonrevenue pilot evacuated the airplane via the R1 door and slide. The crew reported that due to the leftward list of the airplane, the slide was at a steeper angle than normal."

307,ACC1678,"The aircraft was operating a Safari Express Airways charter flight from Klein's Camp to Arusha. The pilot left Arusha the previous day with 185 gallons of fuel and had a night stop in Lake Manyara after flying 5 sectors. There is no record of any refueling in between the sectors. On the next day he flew 3 sectors before the last one, the fourth between 	and Arusha.The pilot stated that he flew at 7500 feet from Klein's Camp to Arusha. When initiating a descend about 11 nm from Arusha, both engines stopped simultaneously. The pilot tried to restart them but failed. He then force-landed at Nangungu in Moduli in an open field. The forced landing in uneven ground resulted in the collapse of left main gear after it contacted a boulder. The left wing consequently contacted the ground. The aircraft suffered damage only on the left wing and the left engine propeller.The passengers deplaned safely and no one was injured. Beside damage to the left wing, left engine propeller and the collapsed main gear, the aircraft cabin and the cockpit were intact.Physical inspection of the wing fuel tanks indicated that all main and tip tanks were completely empty."

There were 100 passengers on board and five crew members. Eight passengers and one crew member survived the accident.ADC Airlines Flight 53 departed Lagos (LOS) on a scheduled domestic flight to Sokoto (SKO) with an intermediate stop at Abuja (ABV). At Abuja at 11:14 local time, the crew of the aircraft requested start-up clearance. This was given along with the prevailing weather information. At 11:21, the crew requested clearance to taxi to the holding point and a wind check; both were given. Over the following six minutes Abuja Tower gave a series of six wind reports, including a statement emphasizing the gusty nature of the wind. A thunderstorm was approaching the airport and weather was worsening. At 11:26, the crew of flight 53 requested clearance for immediate takeoff, and the controller re-emphasized the deteriorating weather condition and gave latest wind check, which they acknowledged.Immediately after takeoff from runway 22, the Boeing 737 entered into a headwind -shift to-tailwind windshear, which significantly affected the aerodynamic performance of the airplane.The Pilot Flying responded to the windshear by adding a small amount of power and by pulling back on the control column causing a significant pitch attitude change.The Pilot-not-flying responded to the windshear by calling for the Pilot Flying to pull up. The airplane then entered into a full aerodynamic stall followed by a roll to the left of over 90 degrees and steep descent into the ground. The aircraft was pitched to an attitude that resulted in the temporary disruption of airflow to and momentary loss of power in both engines. The airplane broke up and caught fire in a corn field."

313,ACC1684,"As the BAe-125 approached Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport(FLL) the flight crew prepared for a visual approach to runway 9L and advised the air traffic controller that the field was in sight. According to the pilot, he was distracted by trying to locate the runway for a visual approach. Although the copilot stated that he read from the ""Before Landing"" and ""Close In"" checklists, the cockpit voice recorder recorded no checklist challenge-response callouts. During the landing, the airplane touched down on the runway with its landing gear retracted and slid about 2,600 feet before coming to a stop, sustaining substantial damage to a structural component and fire damage to the bottom of the fuselage. Following touchdown, the CVR recorded that the pilot asked what happened to the landing gear and that the copilot responded, ""We never put it down.""Although the airplane was equipped with an audible landing gear warning system designed to alert the flight crew that the landing gear is not extended when the airplane is otherwise configured for landing, the CVR captured no sounds that could be associated with the landing gear warning horn, and the pilot reported that he did not hear a warning. Postaccident testing of the airplanes landing gear system revealed that it operated normally using the normal and emergency extension systems and that the cockpit landing gear visual annunciators and standby indicators correctly indicated the landing gear position. However, the audible landing gear warning system did not operate. Examination of the electrical wiring for the warning system revealed that a wire labeled ""68CA8"" was fractured and separated from the ""CA"" relay; this separation rendered the landing gear warning horn inoperative."

319,ACC1690,"The pilot was ferrying the aircraft from Tauranga Airport (TRG) to a Hamilton Airport (HLZ) maintenance facility when one of the engines failed. The pilot elected to turn back to Tauranga but, shortly after, the remaining engine failed. The pilot carried out a forced landing into a tidal estuary. The aircraft incurred substantial damage to the nose landing gear. Subsequent CAA safety investigation determined that on an earlier flight, the aircraft's electrical system incurred a defect that rendered several electrical components unserviceable, including the two tip/main fuel tank selector valves. No engineering inspection or rectification ensued and the operator ferried the aircraft from Great Barrier Island unaware that the engines were being fed from the tip tanks only. The operator departed Tauranga for Hamilton under similar circumstances, reaching the vicinity of the Kaimai Ranges when the tip tanks became empty.The plane stuck fast in the mud and was kept afloat overnight by drums. It was airlifted by a Mil Mi-8 helicopter the next day."
320,ACC1691,"The airplane was on an instrument flight rules flight in night instrument meteorological conditions when the accident occurred. The airplane had been cleared for an ILS approach and the pilot elected to use a non-published procedure to intercept the final approach. After becoming established on the final approach, the airplane impacted the ground about 7 miles from the destination airport at an elevation approximately the same as the airport elevation.Post accident examination of the altimeters revealed that the number one altimeter read 360 feet high. No determination was made as to whether the discrepancy existed prior to impact. However, the pilot did not report any pre-flight discrepancies with regard to the airplane's altimeters."

322,ACC1693,"Peace Air Ltd. Flight PE905 departed Grande Prairie (CYQU) at 10:40 MST on the first leg of a scheduled run to Fort St. John (CYXJ), Fort Nelson, BC, and Grande Prairie. Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight to maintain 12 000 feet above sea level (asl), and to hold on the TAYLOR non directional beacon (NDB), which forms the final approach fix for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 29 at St. John. At 11:09, Flight PE905 was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 29. The first approach was discontinued due to the aircraft being too high on the final approach leg, and clearance was given to return to the TAYLOR NDB at 6000 feet. At 11:23, ATC cleared the flight for another ILS approach to runway 29. The second approach was conducted as a full procedure with the outbound leg extended to ensure that the aircraft was positioned to follow the correct vertical approach profile.The final approach course was flown with a flap setting of 20º and at the company standard operating procedure (SOP) recommended airspeed of 130 knots. At approximately 300 feet above ground level, the first officer informed the captain that he had the ground in sight. The approach lights were visual shortly thereafter. The captain discontinued his instrument scan and confirmed the appearance of the approach lights. The captain made the decision to land, and called for the full flap setting of 35º. The first officer diverted his attention to setting flaps, and to the Vref reference cards clipped to the instrument panel. When he looked up, the aircraft was almost on the ground, but short of the runway. There was insufficient time to warn the captain.The aircraft initially touched down in a nearly wings-level attitude, 320 feet short of the threshold in about 16 inches of packed snow. The left main gear contacted the surface first, followed by the right main gear, and then the nose wheel. The aircraft then struck the last set of approach lights, bounced slightly, and touched down again 180 feet short of the threshold. After sliding through the threshold lights, the aircraft came to rest on the right edge of the runway, 380 feet beyond the threshold. The right main gear had broken off, and the nose gear had collapsed rearward. Both propellers were damaged by ground contact.

The pilot elected to shut it down and return to Fairbanks. During the shutdown procedure, the engine caught fire. The fire extinguishing system was activated.The crew attempted to divert to Nenana Municipal Airport, AK (ENN), but a forced gear-up landing had to be carried out in the tundra. The left wing was consumed by fire."
325,ACC1696,"The purpose of the flight was to pick up a patient at Butler County (BTP) for a subsequent air ambulance transportation flight. The airplane was being flown by the copilot, who was seated in the left seat. At 08:59, the airplane was cleared for the ILS approach to runway 08, a 4,801 foot-long, 100 foot-wide, grooved, asphalt runway. The airplane was being manually flown by the copilot; who stated that the landing approach speed was 106 knots. She recalled being ""a little fast"" on the approach; however, she reduced the engine power to slow down. An eyewitness stated that the airplane appeared ""high and fast"" as it crossed over the runway threshold. The airplane touched down about halfway down the runway, and continued off the departure end. It then struck a wooden localizer antenna platform, and the airport perimeter fence, before crossing a road, and coming to rest about 400 feet from the end of the runway.The airport manager estimated that braking action was ""fair"" at the time of the accident, with about 1/4 to 1/2 of loose, ""fluffy"" snow on the runway."
326,ACC1697,"A Beechcraft 200C Super King Air, VQ-TIU, crashed soon after takeoff from North Caicos Airport (NCA), at the start of a flight bound for Grand Turk Island Airport (GDT), Turks and Caicos Islands. On board were one pilot and five passengers. The pilot received fatal injuries in the accident; the passengers mostly suffered serious injuries. Weather conditions at the time were good, but it was after nightfall; the moon had not risen and there was little cultural lighting in the area.The aircraft crashed into a shallow lagoon approximately one nautical mile south-east of North Caicos Airport. Wreckage was spread along a trail that extended in excess of 370 m along a track of 220°(M). The aircraft's fuselage had come to rest comparatively intact, although lying in an inverted attitude. Evidence from the accident site indicated that the aircraft had struck the water in a nominally upright attitude, with only a moderate rate of descent but at relatively high forward speed.From a detailed examination of the wreckage and the circumstances of the accident, it was concluded that the aircraft was structurally intact and probably under control when it struck the surface. The evidence indicated that each engine was producing power throughout the short flight and at the time of impact. Although anomalies were found which suggested that a possible power asymmetry may have existed, this should not have been sufficient to cause the pilot serious control difficulties.None of the passengers described an obvious problem with the aircraft during the flight, and most remained unaware of the impending crash. The circumstances of the accident suggested that the pilot became spatially disorientated, to the extent that the aircraft diverged from its intended flight path and reached an irrecoverable situation. The environmental conditions were conducive to a disorientation event, and a postmortem toxicological examination showed that the pilot had a level of blood alcohol which, although below the prescribed limit, was significant in terms of piloting an aircraft and would have made him more prone to disorientation.The evidence indicated that the pilot had probably started a recovery to normal flight, but too late to prevent the accident. However, his actions had the effect of reducing the descent rate and placing the aircraft in a nearly level attitude at impact. This lessened the impact damage and helped preserve the fuselage structure relatively intact, increasing the passengers' chance of survival."
327,ACC1698,"The DHC-6 Twin Otter was transporting mining material between Donaldson Lake (YAU) and Berbegamau. During the landing, the aircraft struck a snow bank and the nose wheel broke on impact. Nobody was injured. The aircraft's nose wheel was substantially damaged.The Berbegamau Airstrip is located near the New Quebec Crater in Northern Quebec."
328,ACC1699,"The Cessna Caravan operated out of Goma regularly. On February 15 the airplane departed for Walikale, carrying food. Weather at Walikale was poor. The pilot made three attempts to land. Nothing more was heard from the plane. A rescue mission was launched, but the plane was not located. Also, an ELT signal was not received. By March 2007 the plane still had not been found.The airplane was reportedly operating on behalf of the DRC company Stellavia. Press reported indicate that the company Pass Word, of which the pilot was director, had leased the airplane from Blue Nile Limited.Fatality index and aircraft damage are presumed."
329,ACC1700,"A man armed with two hand guns seized the 737 shortly after takeoff from Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott. He reportedly demanded to be flown to France. It tried to land at Dakhla, in Western Sahara, but Moroccan authorities refused permission. The plane continued to Las Palmas where it landed safely. Passengers and crew overpowered the man and he was arrested by Spanish police."
330,ACC1701,"LFH Luftverkehr Friesland Harle was engaged in scheduled operations between Pärnu and Ruhnu Airport in Estonia, using BN-2 Islander aircraft.The flight that had been initially planned for 26th February 2007, was postponed several times due to adverse meteorological conditions, causing problems with provision supply on Ruhnu island. On Friday, 3rd March, pilot checked the weather at 15:00 and at 16:00. Based on the received information the pilot decided to depart for Ruhnu at 16:00.At 16:08, the aircraft took off from Pärnu airport with a pilot, two passengers and 520 kg of cargo on board. According to the weather briefing received by the pilot via telephone from Kuressaare, at 16:00 the cloud height in Kuressaare (EEKE, 36 Nm northwest of Ruhnu) was 600 ft. and 180 m (approximately 540 ft.) in Ruhnu. During the uneventful flight on the altitude 1500 ft., the coast and the ice border were clearly visible. The aircraft stayed clear from the clouds and no signs of icing were noticed by persons on board. Approaching the island from the northeast it was intended by the pilot to use runway 32 for landing. The pilot decided to fly low from east to west across the runway to check the windsock and runway condition. While approaching the island, the pilot descended at the rate of 150 ft/min with low power settings and flaps extended by 1 notch. During descent the horizontal and vertical visibility deteriorated and the flight was continued in IMC. The descent was continued in clouds; therefore the pilot had no visual contact with the ground and horizon. The aircraft broke through the clouds over the coast at a very low altitude (100-120 feet). Trying to maintain safe altitude and speed pilot added power, at the same time stall warning signal activated and seconds later the lower part of aircraft's fuselage touched the treetops and collided with the terrain at 16:36. The passengers and pilot escaped the aircraft without assistance and with no injuries."
331,ACC1702,"The Il-76 cargo plane was chartered to fly Ugandan peace keeping forces and equipment to Somalia. On final approach, while the airplane was 2,5 - 3 km from the runway at a height of about 120 m, the airplane was struck by a projectile, most likely an RPG. The Il-76 was hit on the left hand side of the fuselage near the main landing gear. A fire erupted, causing smoke inside the plane. The airplane landed safely. After coming to rest, the nine crew members evacuated through the emergency hatch in the flight deck and the UPDF personnel evacuated through the starboard door. It took about one hour for the only fire-fighting truck available at the airport to reach the plane as it had no fuel.The crew thought that the rocket was fired at the plane from small boat as they were approaching over sea."
332,ACC1703,"UTair Aviation flight 471 departed Surgut (SGC) on a regular domestic flight to Belgorod (EGO) via Samara (KUF). Upon departure from Surgut, the weather at Samara was below minima with a visibility of 200 m in fog. An improvement was expected to a visibility of 3000 m upon arrival.The Tupolev Tu-134 took off at 04:08 UTC, climbing to the cruising altitude of 10600 m. En route weather reports showed an improvement to a visibility of 1500 m at Samara. At 06:18 UTC (11:18 local time), shortly after contacting Samara Control, the captain briefed the crew about the arrival procedures for Samara. During the briefing he incorrectly stated that the altitude at which they would capture the glide slope was 500 m (the actual height is 400 m according to the approach charts). About 06:22, Samara Control cleared the flight to descend to 5400 m. During their descent, about 06:30, the ground wind at Samara Airport changed direction from west (270-290°) to southeast (120°) with fog again worsening the visibility.Samara Approach cleared the flight further down to 2400 m and reported of 1200 m with haze and fog. At 06:35 the crew received further clearances in preparation for an approach to runway 23 and the controller reported pressure at the airfield being 745 mm Hg.At 06:37 visibility dropped to 800 m. The meteorological station officer did not inform air traffic control, although he was aware of this significant drop in visibility. Shortly afterward a visibility of 608 m was registered, which was below airport landing minima. This value was not noted by the met station officer and thus not passed on to ATC. At 06:38:53 the flight reported at 400 m. The crew was then instructed to contact the Samara Landing controller, which they did. At 06:40 UCT air traffic control contacted the met station to inquire about the cloud base and horizontal visibility. The met officer reported fog with 800 m visibility but did not mention the cloud base. The cloud base according to the latest ATIS information was 490 m. The actual cloud base measured at the time of the approach was about 30 m.At 06:40:10, at a speed of 380 km/h, the flight engineer lowered the landing gear and the captain trimmed the stabilizer. At 06:40:43, at a speed of 350 km/h, the flaps were extended to 20 degrees. At the same time, the Tu-134 was 10 km on finals, the controller reported the (incorrect) visibility of ""800 m in fog"". At 06:41:09., 8 km out, at a speed of 320 km/h, the flaps were set at 30 degrees. At 06:41:45 the airplane passed the Outer Marker at 200 m. The navigator failed to inform the crew that they had passed the Outer Marker. Thus the pilot did not inform the controller, in order to obtain landing clearance. When the controller inquired about their position, the crew reported ready for landing. At 06:41:55 they were cleared to land. The vertical rate of descent was 6 m/s, which exceeded the recommended rate of descent. The aircraft passed the Inner Marker at a height of 60 m, and a vertical rate of descent of 5,5 m/s with a lateral deviation from the runway axis to the right, no less than 40 m with a further tendency to the right. At decision height the crew had not established positive visual contact with the approach lights. The approach was continued until the airplane contacted the ground, at 06:42:33, 300 m short of the runway and 100 m to the right of the extended centreline. The left wing separated from the fuselage and the plane rolled on its back."
333,ACC1704,"The undercarriage of a Beechcraft B200 Super King Air (registered VH-SGT) collapsed on touchdown at Perth airport. The aircraft was extensively damaged as a result of the collapse. No injuries were sustained by the pilot or passengers from the accident. Approximately two hours earlier, the aircraft was chartered to fly from Perth to Mount Hale, WA when shortly after takeoff from Perth the aircraft experienced a malfunction of the landing gear system. The main wheels and nose gear had become jammed and were unable to fully retract when selected up by the pilot. The pilot completed the emergency checklist actions contained in the Aircraft Flight Manual, but was unable to retract or extend the gear using either the automated control or the manual emergency system. The pilot then requested assistance from a passenger to operate the manual emergency extension system. The landing gear remained jammed despite the additional force applied to the lever from the passenger. The pilot contacted air traffic services and requested further assistance from company engineering personnel to visually assess the extension state of the landing gear. Two aerodrome passes were completed throughout the troubleshooting exercise and the pilot remained in radio contact with both groups during this phase. Following the flyovers and after holding over Rottnest Island at 5,000 ft for a period of approximately two hours, the pilot flew the King Air back to Perth airport. With the gear still jammed in the partially retracted position, both the left and right main landing gear assemblies collapsed after the aircraft touched down on runway 24. The aircraft was substantially damaged as a result of the collapse.The Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation revealed that two major system components had failed which could have prevented the landing gear from properly retracting/extending; the geared components within the right main landing gear actuator had fractured, and the left torque tube support bearing had seized from contamination and lack of lubrication. Although each component failure was apparently unrelated, the examination was not able to conclusively establish which failure had been the primary contributing factor in this landing occurrence. The Super King Air 200 aircraft landing gear system configuration was such that should either one of these component assemblies cease to function, extension or retraction of the landing gear would not have been possible."
334,ACC1705,"The Islander operated on a flight from Ogle to Kato, Kopinang and Madhia before returning to Ogle. The aircraft landed at Kato (KTO) and spent approximately two hours on the ground because of bad weather before departing at 13:45 hrs on a twenty minute flight to Kopinang. En route the airplane contacted trees and crashed."
335,ACC1706,"The Let 410 was used to transport minerals from Walikale to Goma. All flight to Walikale use a 700 m long road located near Kilambo as an airstrip. Preliminary reports indicated that an engine caught fire three minutes after takeoff. The airplane tried to return to the airstrip, but crashed in a forest."
336,ACC1707,"The Twin Otter operated on a flight from Iquitos Airport (SPQT) to Pucallpa (SPCL) with en route stops at Requena (SPQN), Orellana, Pampa Hermosa (SPPH), and Contamana (SPCM). It departed Iquitos at 11:37 and landed in Requena at 12:10. Ten minutes later the Twin Otter departed again, heading for Orellana, where it arrived at 13:10. Departure from Orellana was at 16:25. At 17:45 an ELT signal was received.The wreckage was found in mountainous area; seven passengers had survived the accident."
337,ACC1708,"The runway at Acaricuara Airport was wet from light rain showers earlier that morning. The flight crew decided to execution a low altitude approach to runway 02 with the purpose of making the landing just at the beginning of the runway.The initial contact with the surface occurred with the left main gear in an area of lower height and before the runway threshold. Directional control was lost and the aircraft swing to the left, causing the propellers to hit the ground. The aircraft stopped 200 m further. The three crew members and the four passengers were unharmed."
338,ACC1709,"The converted DC-4 cargo plane carried 3000 gallons of fuel to the Nixon Fork Gold Mine near McGrath, AK. This mine has a 4200 x 100 ft gravel runway (16/34). There is a hill at the south end of the runway which forces everyone to land to the south. The Carvair was coming in with a tail wind, attempting a landing on runway 16. The captain said that the airplane encountered sinking air and became low on the landing approach, and the right main landing gear struck the lip of the runway. The right main landing gear was torn off, which allowed the nose and right wing to collide with the runway surface. The right wing was torn off the fuselage, and caught fire. The airplane slid 180 degrees, went off the runway and ended up in a ditch. The right wing continued to burn for about 1.5 hours.The pilot indicated that the weather conditions consisted of an east wind of about 5 to 10 knots, and mostly clear skies, with isolated areas of convective cloudformations."
339,ACC1710,"On Friday 1 June 2007, a Twin Otter, registered PK-YRU overran the right side of the runway at Mulia Airport (LII). Indonesia during the takeoff roll. The aircraft left the runway and impacted a ditch and rocks on the right shoulder of the runway. Main-wheel tire marks for more than 65 meters on the runway indicated that heavy braking action was being applied to the left brake. The aircraft was substantially damaged. None of the occupants were injured. The handling pilot was undergoing captaincy training under the supervision of an instructor. The investigation was unable to determine why the aircraft commenced veering to the right during the early acceleration phase of the takeoff. The pilots continued the takeoff and directional control was lost during the takeoff roll. The instructor pilot was unable to regain directional control of the aircraft before it left the runway. No aircraft or system defect was found that could have contributed to the pilots inability to maintain directional control during the takeoff roll. The pilot under training stated that ""things happened fast"" and he was ""unaware that the power levers were still in the full on position"", but was ""conscious that his left hand was on the steering handle"". He said that he did not immediately respond to a shout from the instructor to not use the steering handle."
340,ACC1711,"Both engines failed, forcing the pilot to carry out an emergency landing in a field. The airplane came down in a corn field, causing the nose gear to collapse."
341,ACC1712,"The BN-2A-26 Islander landed on a beach when, during the landing roll, the nose wheel encountered soft sand, and was deflected sideways, resulting in structural damage to the firewall bulkhead."
342,ACC1713,"A Britten Norman Islander, N133RS, force-landed in a field about half a mile short of runway 14 at Nassau International Airport. The pilot had reported that the left engine had failed during the approach."
343,ACC1714,"The ATR-72 operated Jet Airways flight 3307 from Delhi to Bhopal, Indore and then back to Delhi, India. The second leg of the flight was uneventful until the final approach. The aircraft bounced on landing, causing the pilot to add power in an attempt to cushion the sink rate. However the aircraft landed hard and bounced again. This was followed with a series of bounces, during which the aircraft migrated from the runway and finally came to full halt on right side close to airport boundary wall. There was no fire.The Indore runway is 7480 feet (2280 m) long."
344,ACC1715,"The Cessna Caravan N208EC was based in Weston Aerodrome outside Dublin. The airplane was requested by the Clifden Airport Committee for a trial flight. The purpose of the flight was a demonstration of an aircraft to a group of potential investors and interested parties associated with a proposed airport at Clifden, Co. Galway, some 25 nm to the northwest of Connemara. The pilot flew to Connemara-Inverin in the morning together with an Aircraft Maintenance Specialist and conducted a familiarisation flight to Inishmaan (Inis Meáin). The group assembled at Connemara, but as there were too many passengers to be accommodated on one aircraft, two flights were proposed with the aircraft returning to pick up the remainder. The aircraft then departed with the first part of the group. On arrival at Inishmaan, the pilot contacted those remaining and informed them that he would not be returning for them because he was uncomfortable with the weather. This did not cause a problem because an Aer Arran Islander aircraft, with its pilot, was available to fly the remainder of the group across to Inishmaan.Following lunch and a presentation the group returned to Connemara. N208EC took off with eight passengers on board. There had been a significant wind shift, since the time the aircraft had departed earlier from Connemara that morning, of which the pilot appeared to be unaware. As a result a landing was attempted downwind on runway 05. At a late stage, a go-around was initiated, at a very low speed and high power setting. The aircraft turned to the left, did not gain altitude and maintained a horizontal trajectory. It hit a mound, left wing first and cartwheeled. The pilot and one of the passengers were fatally injured. The remaining seven passengers were seriously injured. The aircraft was destroyed but there was no fire."
345,ACC1716,"According to the pilot, before the flight, prior to the accident flight, he placed a fuel order, but did not verify that the twin-engine airplane was refueled before departing with 8 passengers for a cross country flight. This flight reached its destination without incident, the passengers exited the airplane, and the pilot then departed as the sole occupant of the airplane on a repositioning flight. Shortly after takeoff, at an altitude of about 400 feet agl, the left engine ""started to sputter."" The pilot executed the engine failure checklist and upon retarding the left throttle, the airplane yawed to the left giving the pilot the impression it was still producing power. He decided not to shut down the engine and began a right turn to return to the departure airport. During the turn, the right engine ""started to sputter,"" and he noticed the fuel tank indicators were both on empty. The pilot decided to leave all controls forward and gave no further thought to shutting down or feathering either engine. Shortly thereafter, he realized he would not make the runway and elected to land in an open field. During the landing roll, the airplane encountered a ditch, resulting in collapse of the left main landing gear."
346,ACC1717,The Antonov was operating on a flight from Kinshasa-N'Dolo (NLO) to Nioki (NIO) via Bandundu (FDU). Shortly after takeoff from Bandundu the no. 1 engine failed. Altitude was lost and the plane crash-landed.Press reports did not indicate the exact Antonov model. Malift Air is understood to have one An-24 and one An-32.
347,ACC1718,"During the initial takeoff climb, about 200 feet above ground level, the flight crew heard a loud bang from the engine followed by a loss of engine power. The propeller was feathered immediately after the loss of power. The airplane impacted with the terrain during the force landing, the wings were damaged by trees. The airplane flipped over onto its back when the nose gear dropped into a trench."
348,ACC1719,The Antonov An-32 touched down nose-first causing severe damage to the  nose landing gear.
349,ACC1720,"The DC-3 departed San José del Guaviare (SJE) on a domestic flight to Villavicencio (VVC). One engine failed, after which the crew was forced to carry out an emergency landing in a rice field.Some reports indicate that the plane was operated by SADELCA instead of Aerovanguardia."
350,ACC1721,"The Antonov plane was loaded with about 9 tons of cassiterite (tin oxide) and other minerals at the Kongolo Airport (KOO). Twelve passengers also boarded the flight to Goma (GOM). The three crew members were Ukrainian and Russian. The airplane reportedly developed engine trouble about ten minutes after takeoff. The crew attempted to return to the Kongolo but the airplane contacted trees, crashed and burned short of the runway."
351,ACC1722,"The An-32 cargo plane had arrived at Mitú, Colombia, carrying drums of fuel. After unloading the fuel there was a spill that was initially responded to by the crew. Airport firefighters approached to attend the event but were not allowed the use of foam or water due to electrical and electronic equipment that could be affected by the liquid. After starting the APU and engine no.2 for the flight back to Villavicencio, the crew felt an explosion and shut down the engines. Firefighters were unable to extinguish the rapidly developing fire."
352,ACC1723,The F-28 landed long on Dawei (TVY) runway 34. It overran the runway and the nose landing gear collapsed as it dug into soft ground.
353,ACC1724,"The Cessna Caravan was on a reposition flight to Tampa International Airport, FL (TPA). The airplane was in cruise flight at 11,000 feet agl, 29 miles east of Cross City Airport in Florida, when suddenly with no warning or spool down time, the engine failed. The engine's gauges instantly went to zero. Upon the engine failure, the pilot declared an emergency with air traffic control and was advised that the closest airport was the Cross City Airport on a heading of 080 and 29 miles away. He turned the airplane toward the airport and went through the engine out procedures. The attempts to restart the engine were unsuccessful. He had the aircraft set up for best glide speed; the glide was approximately 22 miles. When the airplane was about 300 feet agl, he opened the crew door and latched it open. He slowed the airplane to just above stall speed before impacting the trees. Upon contact with the trees, he pulled back on the yoke and stalled the airplane into the trees. He was able to exit the airplane without assistance. The airplane came to rest 8.2 miles east of the Cross City Airport."
354,ACC1725,Collided with the ground shortly after takeoff from runway 17; pilot and technician fatally injured.Investigators found that the rudder trim was set to the full left at the time of the accident as opposed to the normal (central) take off setting.
355,ACC1726,"An Airbus A330-322 passenger plane, D-AERK, sustained substantial damage when it lost engine cowlings after takeoff from Düsseldorf International Airport (DUS).The airplane landed safely back at Düsseldorf and no one was injured.The A330 had departed Düsseldorf on a flight to Thessaloniki International Airport (SKG), Greece. It was climbing through FL105 when the crew heard a loud bang, followed by some unusual noises. The crew then checked the locking of the doors and hatches but found no problems. Since no errors were detected by the aircraft monitoring system (ECAM) the flight continued. Shortly afterwards a cabin crew member reported the loss of a large part of the engine cowling of the left engine.The crew then decided to cancel the flight and return to Düsseldorf. The crew did not declare an emergency. The aircraft landed without further problems in Düsseldorf. At the parking position fuel was seen leaking from the left wing because of hole in the underside of the wing. Further damage was caused to the belly fairing and underlying structure and hydraulics."
356,ACC1727,"A Beechcraft A100 King Air, N30GC, impacted trees about 3/4 mile from the departure end of runway 26R at Chino Airport (CNO), CA. The wreckage came to rest inverted in an open field located on the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) facility near the airport. The airplane was destroyed. The commercial instrument rated pilot and the passenger were fatally injured. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight. The reported weather at the time of the accident was calm winds, a 1/4-mile visibility in fog and a vertical visibility of 100 feet. Shortly after takeoff for the instrument-flight-rules flight, the airplane made a slight turn to the left and impacted the tops of 25-foot trees about a 1/2 mile from the runway. An enhanced ground proximity warning system was installed on the airplane and data extraction from the system indicated that the airplane achieved an initial positive climb profile with a slight turn to the left and then a descent. A witness reported hearing the crash and observed the right wing impact the ground and burst into flames. The airplane then cartwheeled for several hundred feet before coming to rest inverted. The airframe, engines, and propeller assemblies were inspected with no mechanical anomalies noted that would have precluded normal flight."
357,ACC1728,"Global 5000 C-GXPR departed Hamilton (YHM) at 11:53 EST on a flight to the Fox Harbour private airstrip. During the landing the aircraft touched down about seven feet short of the runway, impacting the runway edge or lip, causing significant gear damage and subsequent collapse. The aircraft slid on its fuselage and right wing departing the right side of the runway surface. After crossing several low earthen berms it came to a stop approximately 1000 feet from the runway threshold."
358,ACC1729,The pilot aborted takeoff but was not able to stop the airplane on the remaining runway. The Grand Caravan struck a barbed wire fence and ran into several oranges trees before coming to a halt some 520 feet beyond the runway.The undercarriage was sheared off and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the belly.
359,ACC1730,"The Cessna 208B was on a mail delivery flight from Bethel (BET) to Hooper Bay (HPB) Scammon Bay (SCM), Alaska. The airplane crash landed on a tundra hill immediately after takeoff. It skidded about 100 yards, leaving a trail of debris, including the plane's wheels and cargo.The pilot indicated that the airplane was initially climbing with 20 degrees of flaps after departing runway 36. He retracted the flaps half way at 100 knots of airspeed, and then fully retracted the flaps at 110 knots. The pilot said that the airplane then began to roll to the right in a manner he described as a wave, or vortex feeling. He corrected the roll, lowered the nose of the airplane, and it again rolled to the right, which he again corrected. The airplane rolled to the right a third time, and the pilot saw that the airplane was descending to the ground. He attempted to lower the flaps before the airplane collided with the ground.The weather observed at Bethel at 08:53 AST was: clear skies, Temperature:-12F (-24C) Dewpoint: -18F (-28C), Relative Humidity: 73%, Winds from the NW (330 degs) at 12 mph. Pressure: 1006.5 millibars. Altimeter:29.71 inches of mercury. The prevailing visibility was 10 miles.The same aircraft, N5187B, was damaged in December 1999 when it crash-landed during takeoff from Bethel due to icing."

361,ACC1732,"Alpine Air flight 253 departed Honolulu (HNL) at 04:43 carrying about 4,200 pounds of mail on a regularly scheduled flight to Kauai, Lihue (LIH).It was scheduled to arrive at Lihue at 05:15. The pilot had routine contact with air traffic control, and was advised by the controller to maintain 6,000 feet at 05:01 when the airplane was 11 miles from the destination airport. Two minutes later the flight was cleared for a visual approach to follow a preceding Boeing 737 (Aloha Airlines Flight 917) and advised to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency at the airport. The pilot altered his flight course to the west, most likely for spacing from the airplane ahead, and descended into the water as he began a turn back toward the airport. The majority of the wreckage sank in 4,800 feet of water.The pilot most likely descended into the ocean because he became spatially disoriented. Although visual meteorological conditions prevailed, no natural horizon and few external visual references were available during the visual approach. This increased the importance of monitoring flight instruments to maintain awareness of the airplane attitude and altitude. The pilot's tasks during the approach, however, included maintaining visual separation from the airplane ahead and lining up with the destination runway. These tasks required visual attention outside the cockpit. These competing tasks probably created shifting visual frames of reference, left the pilot vulnerable to common visual and vestibular illusions, and reduced his awareness of the airplane's attitude, altitude and trajectory."
362,ACC1733,"The airplane crashed into a mountain during an approach to land at Huambo Airport (NOV), Angola. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed. The pilot, copilot and eleven passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was destroyed and there was ground fire.Weather was poor (rainy and foggy). Preliminary reports suggests the aircraft was flying below the minimum safe altitude over the mountainous area."
363,ACC1734,"The plane skidded off the left side of the runway and hit a group of people waiting nearby, killing one and injuring two others."
364,ACC1735,"The Cessna 525 CitationJet CJ1 N102PT was parked in a hangar at Augusta State Airport, ME (AUG) in the morning, at the pilot's request. However, the airline that used the hangar needed to house a plane. Since they had priority, the Citation was taken out of the hangar about 16:30 and moved back to the ramp area. While the airplane was on the ramp, the weather condition had turned from light snow to freezing rain. The pilot and her passenger arrived at the airport about 17:15. About 1730, the airplane's engines were started and the airplane was observed taxing. The FBO representative heard the pilot's announcements over the radio in the FBO. He also noticed the airplane was not on the taxiway, but on the grass area on the south side of the asphalt taxiway. At that time the ground was covered with snow and ice. The FBO representative noted the pilot did not activate the airport's taxi and runways lights via the common airport frequency radio channel. It was observed that the airplane taxied through a ditch, which was covered with ice and snow. The airplane's engines were heard at a high rate of power about this time. It was later discovered that the airplane's left main tire broke through the ice and became stuck in the ditch. The airplane continued on the grass area after the high engine power was heard. The FBO representative heard the pilot announce the wrong runway (runway 35) that she was planning to depart from. The FBO representative turned on the runway and taxi lights after hearing the incorrect runway announcement. The pilot later announced a change of departure from runway 35 to runway 17, while the airplane was observed back taxing on runway 26 onto taxiway ""C"". About 17:45 the airplane took off from runway 17.After takeoff, the pilot contacted the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) and reported that she was at 1,000 feet, climbing to 10,000 feet. About one minutelater, the pilot declared an emergency and stated, ""We've got an attitude indicator failure"". About seven seconds later, the pilot announced over the frequency they were not certain which way they were turning. Radar contact was lost shortly after that."
365,ACC1736,"The pilot reported that it was snowing during his preflight activities and takeoff roll. A snowplough operator stated that he had cleared approximately four passes on either side of the runway centerline when the accident airplane taxied onto the runway. The pilot back-taxied on the departure runway to determine how much snow covered the runway. During the subsequent takeoff roll, at approximately 80 knots, the left main landing gear encountered some deeper snow that caused the airplane to swerve left off of the runway centerline. The pilot attempted to correct the left swerve with right rudder input, but the airplane continued off the left side of the runway. The airplane was substantially damaged when its nose landing gear impacted a snowbank."
366,ACC1737,"The crew reportedly had to abort takeoff due to engine problems. The ATR-72 failed to stop within the remaining runway length and overran by 100 feet. It went up an embankment, causing the fuselage to break in two just forward of the wing.Putao's singe runway (17/35) measures 7000 x 100 feet."
367,ACC1738,"The pilot, accompanied by six passengers, was engaged in a private flight from Bloemfontein International Airport (BFN) to Cape Town International Airport (CPT).The aircraft was cleared for landing at Cape Town runway 19 by ATC. According to the pilot, he had selected the landing gear down and had three green light indications in the cockpit, indicating that the landing gear was down and locked. While the aircraft was established on final approach, the before-landing checklist checks were performed and full flaps were selected for landing. Touch-down was normal and about halfway during the landing roll the pilot felt the left side of the aircraft is slowly sinking. The left-hand propeller then struck the runway surface. The pilot made the necessary corrective action to keep the aircraft straight on the runway and to keep the sinking wing up as long as possible. The aircraft came to a halt to the left of the runway centre line.Nobody was injured in the accident but the aircraft sustained substantial damage to the left-hand wing, flaps, propeller and engine."
368,ACC1739,"Flight QUE10M, a Government of Québec Challenger 601 jet, was conducting a medical evacuation flight in accordance with instrument flight rules (IFR) from Bonaventure to Québec, Canada. There were eight people on board. When the landing gear was lowered, the front landing gear failed to deploy. Several attempts failed. An emergency was declared and the aircraft landed without the nosewheel on snow-covered runway 06. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the front landing gear. No one was injured."
369,ACC1740,"The aircraft stalled, hit a hill and caught fire some 3 km from Mwanza Airport. The captain (citizen of the United Kingdom) and the trainee pilot (a resident of Australia) were killed instantly."
370,ACC1741,"The Sudanese An-32 had been ferried to Moldova for maintenance. On April 11, 2008 the airplane was prepared to be ferried back from Chisinau (KIV) to Khartoum, Sudan via Antalya (AYT). It took off from the Chisinau International Airport at 22:02. After takeoff, the crew noticed that the transponder had failed. The flight returned to Chisinau. On final approach the airplane contacted VOR/DME equipment, crashed and burned."
371,ACC1742,"The aircraft departed Deer Lake, Newfoundland and Labrador, and upon selecting gear up, the hydraulic light and the annunciator came on. The captain immediately shut the hydraulic pump off as per memory checks. After completing the checklist it was determined that they had a hydraulic leak in the system. The main accumulator still had some fluid so they decided to bypass Gander and continue on to St. John's where the weather was better. Landing was normal. The captain had some steering and soft brakes. The captain decided to taxi the aircraft onto the ramp area. He feathered the propeller about 150 feet from the hangar. The forward thrust from the props going into feather gave the aircraft some forward momentum. With the slight downgrade the aircraft rolled until it hit Hangar 3. The captain had no brakes or steering. There is substantial damage to the nose cone area. The hydraulic leak was caused by the failure of a hydraulic swivel in the right hand landing gear."
372,ACC1743,"A Beechcraft T-1A Jayhawk jet trainer sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB). The crew suffered no significant injuries.The instructor and pilot were both assigned to the U.S. Air Force 86th Flying Training Squadron, 47th Flying Training Wing, Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas.The accident occurred while the crew was flying a Mission Qualification Training (MQT) flight to familiarize the pilot, as a new instructor, with local area mission procedures.The crew was on their second flight of the day. They took off from runway 17R with the intent to fly the Localizer Approach (a non-precision approach) to runway 26, circle to runway 17R, and stay in the pattern for more approaches. The crew was aware of rainshowers in the vicinity of the airport, gusty surface winds, blowing dust, and strong winds at altitude, approximately 35-40 knots. During the circling approach, the crew elected to go-around because of the winds. As the crew turned and aligned to final approach, the airplane experienced a rapid nose down change in its pitch, and the crew felt a sinking sensation. The crew set the throttles at their maximum performance in order to gain altitude. The airplane did not respond but kept descending. The crew applied stall recovery procedures and continued to maneuver the jet toward runway 17R. The crew reported, ""Major gust, major gust"" on the radio to the tower just prior to impact. The airplane hit the ground, sheared off its nose landing gear, and, after traveling some distance, came to rest on its main landing gear with its nose on the ground."
373,ACC1744,The An-12 had delivered cargo at Chelyabinsk (CEK) and was heading back to Perm (PEE). The airplane took off from runway 09 at 14:03 UTC. About a minute after takeoff the crew reported smoke in the cockpit. They requested permission to return for landing on runway 09. While positioning for an approach to runway 09 smoke continued to fill the flight deck. The crew also received several (false) warnings. Then two engines automatically shut down. Aileron control was lost about 11 km before landing. The aircraft struck terrain and burned.
374,ACC1745,"The accident happened during a training flight at Sidra Airstrip, owned by the Waha Oil Company, Libya."

376,ACC1747,The Cessna Grand Caravan was carrying mail when the crew were forced to carry out an emergency landing. The airplane touched down on the Santarém-Cuiabá Highway (BR-163) but the pilot steered the plane into bushes when noticing traffic ahead. The airplane sustained substantial damage.
377,ACC1748,"A Maldivian Air Taxi seaplane departed at 12:11 hrs from the MAT dock at Male International Airport, water aerodrome. It was flying fourteen tourists to the Adaaran Club Bathala (North Ari Atoll). The weather was windy and sea was rough. The estimated flight time to destination was 20 minutes. Around 12:30the aircraft approached for landing near the floating platform located in the lagoon north of Adaaran Club Bathala. The wind was on a westerly direction 20 to 25 knots and the aircraft approached for a westbound landing. The aircraft made an orbit over the lagoon to inspect water and approached towards the platform for landing. The aircraft touched down and was cutting the top of the wave, as they usually do to find an appropriate location for stopping. Before it could find an appropriate place to stop it hit a big swell. This caused the aircraft to sway to the left and get airborne. The PIC called for a go around and tried to correct the left sway. As it was climbing with a right bank it collided with a speed boat, moored to the buoy which was located to the west of the platform. The RH float collided with the bow of the speed boat, which caused the RH float and the RH engine to detach the aircraft. The aircraft yawed to the right and the PIC managed to land the aircraft and bring it to a halt on LH float. Due to high wave current the aircraft drifted towards the shallow area and sank. The passengers and crew was able to escape the aircraft without any fatalities."
378,ACC1749,"An Airbus A321 operated by Thomas Cook Airlines on a charter return flight from Manchester, U.K. to Ibiza, Spain, was damaged in a hard landing accident at Manchester.The flight crew consisted of three pilots; a training captain who occupied the left flight deck seat and was the commander, a co-pilot undertaking the first two sectors of line training who occupied the right flight deck seat, and another first officer who occupied a flight deck jump seat.The flight back towards Manchester progressed normally and the commander prepared the aircraft for a flap full landing on runway 23R, adjusting the approach speed in the FMGS to ensure a five knot margin above VLS.The weather at Manchester was good with the 19:50 hrs observation indicating that the wind was 180°/5 kt. At approximately 8 nm from touchdown, the commander handed control to the co-pilot. The co-pilot disconnected the autopilot at 1,200 ft and left the autothrust engaged.The commander watched the co-pilots sidestick inputs and recalled that he was ""over-active"" on the sidestick.He stated that he perceived this to be a common problem with pilots transitioning onto the Airbus aircraft.At 1,000 ft, the commander noted that the operators stable approach parameters were satisfied and stated ""stable A321"" in accordance with the operators SOPs.The commander gave a coaching narrative during the final moments before touchdown but, as the co-pilot closed the thrust levers, realised that the landing was ""going to go wrong"". The aircraft touched down firmly and bounced. The commander stated that he considered taking control, but noted that the co-pilot appeared to be holding the aircrafts attitude and that intervention was not necessary. Although the commander believed that he made no sidestick input, FDR data showed that he did move it slightly. After the second touchdown, the landing progressed normally. The co-pilot taxied the aircraft to its parking stand and disembarkation took place.The commander and co-pilot discussed the landing and both considered it not to have been ""heavy"". The commander asked some company line engineers, who had travelled back from Ibiza as passengers, for their opinions of the landing and specifically whether they thought it was a hard landing. They replied that if no ""load 15 report"" had been produced on the flight deck printer and the commander did not consider the landing to have been ""heavy"", then in their opinion, no action needed to be taken. The commander was unfamiliar with this ""load 15 report"" (though he knew that the aircraft was capable of printing a report after a heavy landing), but confirmed that no report had been printed.The presence of a landing parameter exceedence report was identified after a further two sectors had been flown, when an unrelated inspection of the landing gear found a crack in a wing rib gear support lug."
379,ACC1750,"The F-27 took off from Guayaramerin (GYA) at 11:56 on a domestic flight to Trinidad (TDD), where it was expected to arrive around 13:30.At 12:20 the crew radioed they experienced problems with the no. 1 engine. A forced landing was carried out on a road, causing substantial damage to the aircraft."
380,ACC1751,"Airbus A321 G-MARA was operating a night charter flight from Malaga, Spain to Manchester Airport, UK, with the co-pilot as the pilot flying (PF). The flight had been operated in accordance with company procedures and had been without incident until the landing. The landing flare was initiated slightly early and the aircraft settled into a float at approximately 10 ft abovethe runway (radio height). Whilst in the float, the co-pilots sidestick briefly moved to fully forward then to fully aft. The aircraft reacted with a rapid nose-down pitch and touched down in a near flat attitude. A significant bounce occurred, which was controlled by the co-pilot; a second touchdown and rollout ensued The commander taxied the aircraft to the parking stand where it was shut down normally.Three passenger service unit oxygen masks had dropped from their stowages but no other effects of the landing were apparent and no injuries had occurred.An engineer, following the process in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM), determined that no inspections were required as the relevant recorded parameters had not exceeded the stated threshold values.On the next flight, the flight crew were unable to retract the landing gear. Subsequent investigation of this defect identified internal damage to the nose landing gear and a bent proximity switch link rod. The nose landing gear was replaced and extensive inspections conducted before the aircraft was released to service."

384,ACC1755,"While en route to his destination, the pilot experienced variations in the airplane's cabin pressure. The pilot removed his noise-cancelling headset and was able to detect an air leak from the area of the entrance door. Moments later, the airplane encountered turbulence and the door departed the airplane causing substantial damage to the fuselage. The pilot declared an emergency and was able to land at the nearest suitable airfield.During his preflight inspection, the pilot secured the door ""normally,"" but could not recall if he visually confirmed that the door was secured. The fuselage door frame did not display signs of deformation where the entrance door's bayonets seat into the door frame. The door was not recovered and an examination for mechanical failure could not be conducted."
385,ACC1756,The Twin Otter reportedly crashed short of runway 23 and struck a small house.
386,ACC1757,"A Beechcraft A200 Super King Air, N30W, sustained substantial damage during a runway overrun while landing at Bridgewater Air Park VA. The certificated airline transport pilot and his one passenger were uninjured. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local maintenance flight. According to the pilot who was an employee of the United States Department of Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management, he and a mechanic needed to do a quick maintenance test flight to check the pressurization system before departing for California the following day. The pilot advised that he had followed the maintenance done to the airplane during the day while attending to other business associated with an upgrade to the avionics system.The pilot asked to have the two right main tires changed and monitored that maintenance activity as well. At approximately 17:00, the pilot had the airplane's main fuel tanks filled completely. He then did his normal checks and walk around, and taxied the airplane to the end of runway 33 for a quick around the pattern flight.He departed runway 33, and did a few checks on the pressurization and flow packs, verifying functionality. The pilot then set up for a landing on runway 33 and upon touchdown, decided to add power and go-around, as something did not feel right.The pilot then came around for a second landing and landed long touching down approximately 700 feet down the runway, set his normal amount of beta (reverse) and started to apply brakes. He then realized that there was the possibility that he was going to ""overshoot"" because of poor braking action on the wet runway.The pilot found that it was very easy to skid the left brake, and that the right brake braking action was poor, until further down the runway. He decided not to abort the landing and go-around, due to the airplanes low indicated airspeed, the configuration of the airplane, the runway remaining, the rising terrain, and houses.The pilot tried to turn to the left without side loading the landing gear and thought he had the airplane stopped, until the airplane rolled off the runway pavement and on to the grass which was wet and he had no braking at all. The airplane then rolled down a steep embankment and entered the river at a 45-degree angle to the riverbank. The right wingtip hit first and then both propellers struck the edge of the riverbank."

The first officer was pilot flying. As the first officer maneuvered the airplane from base leg to final, she advanced the engine power levers to adjust the airplanes approach path, but there was no response from the right engine. The airplane began to yaw to the right, and the captain took control of the airplane, initiated a go-around, and added full engine power in an attempt to climb the airplane away from rising terrain. About 500 to 600 feet above the ground, the airplane's yaw to the right intensified, and it began to descend rapidly. The captain applied full left aileron and rudder to correct the yaw, but he was unable to maintain altitude. He selected an area of tundra-covered terrain as a forced landing site. The airplane struck the ground with the right main landing gear, and right front portion of the fuselage. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and empennage."

395,ACC1766,"A Dornier 228 with 14 people on board operated by Summit Air Charters, was on approach at Cambridge Bay (YCB) after a flight from Resolute Bay (YRB) when the aircraft collided with terrain about 2,5 km short of the runway. One flight crew member and one passenger received minor injuries.The aircraft departed Resolute Bay with 12 passengers on December 12 at 23:45. The aircraft cruised en route to Cambridge Bay at flight level 100, with the crew using a global positioning system (GPS) as the primary navigation aid. At 01:17 the captain briefed the first officer that they would proceed direct to the LEXUP waypoint and conduct a straight-in visual approach to Runway 31 True. At 01:34, 16 nm from Cambridge Bay, the crew contacted Cambridge Bay Airport Radio with a position report and estimated time of arrival of five minutes. Airport Radio advised that there was no reported traffic, the wind was at 300° True (T) at 15 knots gusting to 20.At 01:38, five nm north of LEXUP, the aircraft descended out of cloud to 2100 feet asl. Ground features of dark rocks against white snow were intermittently visible to the crew. A descent was then begun to 1200 feet asl. At one nm from LEXUP, the landing gear was selected down, and pre-landing checks were commenced by the first officer. Shortly after crossing LEXUP, the captain noticed that the GPS equipment had not automatically sequenced to the missed approach waypoint at the threshold of Runway 31 True. While the first officer reprogrammed the GPS for a direct course to the threshold, the aircraft proceeded southbound on a track approximately 90° to the inbound course to the runway. The GPS indicated the direct course to the runway threshold of 319°T, or 11° greater than the published approach final approach course (308°T). At about 1.3 nm south of the extended runway centre-line, a right turn was commenced, and the aircraft was directed toward the diffused lights from the settlement of Cambridge Bay on a track varying between about 332°T and 020°T. A descent of 400 to 500 feet per minute was initiated at this time. The last available radar altitude data at 0140:53 indicated 810 feet asl when the aircraft was 5.8 nm from the threshold. At 0141:30, the radar altitude 500-foot alert activated, and the first officer brought this to the attention of the captain. There was no further reference made by either crew member in regard to actual or published approach altitudes, and neither pilot monitored the aircrafts altimeters during the remainder of the approach.The aircraft crossed the extended runway centreline for the second time, 2.8 nm from the runway threshold; at 2.1 nm, a left turn was made toward the runway centreline. When the runway lead-in strobe lights became dimly visible, the captain turned toward the runway. The precision approach path indicator system (PAPI), positioned on the left side of the runway, 1000 feet from the threshold, was not visible to the crew. Due to reflected glare from falling and blowing snow, the captain requested that the aircrafts landing lights be turned off, and confirmed with Cambridge Bay Airport Radio that the runway lights were at maximum illumination level. A maximum of two runway lights were visible to the captain. Fifteen seconds before ground impact, the propellers were set to SPEEDS HIGH and flaps were set to FLAPS 1. The aircraft contacted the ground in a shallow descent with wings level, on a track of 310°T. It came to rest on flat, snow-covered terrain near the extended runway centreline, 542 feet from the initial point of contact at 70 feet asl.The occupants evacuated the aircraft immediately through the main cabin door and the emergency window exits. After an evaluation of the state of the aircraft, the crew and passengers re-entered the cabin to reduce exposure to the elements. The crew notified Cambridge Bay Airport Radio of the occurrence and ground rescue personnel found the site within 30 minutes utilizing snow machines. The pilots illuminated the aircrafts landing lights occasionally to help the rescue team find the aircraft."

426,ACC1797,"A Britten-Norman BN-2A Trislander Mk.III-1 passenger plane sustained substantial damage in an accident near Great Barrier Island Airport (GBZ), New Zealand. There were ten passengers and one pilot on board. Three passengers suffered minor injuries.At about 13:00 the 3-engined Trislander took off from Great Barrier Aerodrome at Claris on Great Barrier Island on a regular service to Auckland International Airport (AKL). When climbing through about 500 feet the pilot heard an unusual ""pattering"" sound. He also heard the propellers going out of synchronisation, so he attempted to resynchronise them with the propeller controls. He checked the engine's gauges and noticed that the right engine manifold pressure and engine rotation speed had dropped, so he adjusted the engine and propeller controls to increase engine power. At that time there was a loud bang and he heard a passenger scream. Looking back to his right the pilot saw that the entire propeller assembly for the right engine was missing and that there was a lot of oil spray around the engine cowling. The pilot turned the airplane left and completed the engine failure and shutdown checks. He transmitted a distress call on the local area frequency and asked the other company pilot, who was airborne behind him, to alert the local company office that he was returning to Claris. Despite the failure, ZK-LOU continued to climb, so the pilot said he levelled at about 800 feet and reduced power on the 2 serviceable engines, completed a left turn and crossed over the aerodrome and positioned right downwind for runway 28. There was quite a strong headwind for the landing, so the pilot elected to do a flapless landing and keep the power and speed up a little because of the possibility of some wind shear. After landing, the pilot stopped the airplane on the runway and checked on the passengers before taxiing to the apron. Three of the passengers received some minor abrasions and scrapes from shattered Perspex and broken interior lining when the propeller struck the side of the fuselage."

432,ACC1803,"A Russian Yak-40 jet sustained substantial damage during a failed go around at Aktyubinsk Airport (AKX), Kazakhstan. The airplane, operated by Bugulma Air Enterprise, carried out a charter flight from Kazan Airport (KZN), Russia to Aktyubinsk Airport (AKX) -- also known as Aktobe, with an intermediate stop at Begishevo (NBC), Russia. The airplane was chartered by the SMP-Neftegaz oil company.The flight was uneventful. Upon landing at Aktyubinsk, the crew felt a movement to the left when the nose landing gear touched the runway. The pilot pulled the nose up. He feared that lowering the nose would result in a loss of directional control again. He ordered a go around and instructed the crew to stow the reversers The undercarriage was retracted at a height of 3-5 m above the runway. The airplane sank back with the tail striking the runway."
433,ACC1804,"A Beechcraft B200 King Air, N726CB, sustained substantial damage after impacting terrain while maneuvering during initial climb at the Hayward Executive Airport, CA (HWD). The commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight. The airplane just had undergone a routine maintenance and this was planned to be the first flight after the inspection. During the initial climb, the pilot observed that the airplane was drifting to the left. The pilot attempted to counteract the drift by application of right aileron and right rudder, but the airplane continued to the left. The pilot reported that, despite having both hands on the control yoke, he could not maintain directional control and the airplane collided into a building. The airplane subsequently came to rest on railroad tracks adjacent to the airport perimeter.A post accident examination revealed that the elevator trim wheel was located in the 9-degree NOSE UP position; normal takeoff range setting is between 2 and 3 degrees NOSE UP. The rudder trim control knob was found in the full left position and the right propeller lever was found about one-half inch forward of the FEATHER position; these control inputs both resulted in the airplane yawing to the left.The pilot did not adequately follow the airplane manufacturer's checklist during the preflight, taxi, and before takeoff, which resulted in the airplane not being configured correctly for takeoff. This incorrect configuration led to the loss of directional control immediately after rotation. A post accident examination of the airframe, engines, and propellers revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation."
434,ACC1805,"A CASA C-212 Aviocar, N349TA, sustained substantial damage in a runway excursion during landing at Savoonga Airport, AK (SVA) runway 05. Both pilots were not injured.

The flight departed Nome Airport, AK (OME), about 13:12.On approach, the flight overflew the runway at 500 feet prior to entering the pattern at 800 feet. The captain indicated that they flew a teardrop approach and noted that the winds were 50-degrees to the runway from the north. The pilot stated that he had to crab the airplane into the wind while on final. After touchdown, while on the rollout, the pilot indicated that he tried to maintain aircraft control with the aileron into the wind and forward pressure on the nose; however, the airplane was difficult to control and it began to veer to the right side of the runway. The airplane continued to the right, exited the runway surface, and came to rest in a ditch adjacent to the landing runway.The pilots characterized the weather at Savoonga as overcast skies, gusty winds, and light rain. They also reported that runway had been recently graded and was rough."

The aircraft arrived at Um-galala airstrip 5 days before the accident date and carried out seven spraying flight in the previous five days.The spraying of birds start daily about 18:30 local time and took about 50 minutes flight. According to the scheduled operation the aircraft started its flight ten minutes before Sun set to fly to the assigned bird location for spraying chemicals.On the day of the accident the airstrip lights were positioned by the captain himself at the edges of the airstrip. He put seven lamps at the left side and three lamps at the right side of the airstrip. The red lamp which should have been placed at the beginning of the airstrip was not placed that day due to a flat battery.At about 15:45 UTC the aircraft took-off for spraying birds. That night was dark and there was no moon light. After takeoff the technician switched on all lamps except the red one waiting for aircraft arrival.Fifty minutes after takeoff the aircraft was seen approaching the airstrip. The aircraft came flying over the strip at a height of about 25 meters and made a left turn. The aircraft then made another approach and came over the left row of lamps at a height of about 10 meters, as stated by the technician, and made a sharp left turn. At that instant the aircraft went down and crashed east of the airstrip. A fire erupted. The pilot died of his injuries.Although the airplane was formally registered ST-AUS in July 2009, the airplane still carried its previous Polish registration mark SP-WMH."

439,ACC1810,"On the day before the accident, the Ilyushin Il-76MD transport plane delivered a batch of cargo to Mirny, Russia. During taxiing after landing, the crew activated the electrical part of the rudder and aileron locking system. The ""Lock On"" light illuminated. On the morning of the next day, a ferry flight to Chita was planned, with an en route stop at Irkutsk.In the course of preflight checks, the crew took steps to bring the electromechanical part of the locking system to the ""disengaged"" position. At the same time the ""Lock on"" light remained illuminated. Accepting it as a false alarm, the captain decided to take off. The operability of the aileron control system was checked by deflecting the steering wheel to the left and then to the right. During deflection to the right, the right aileron was locked due to its locking mechanism. At 07:48 the flight took off in darkness from runway 24. At the beginning of the takeoff run, the engine power was set to a position below the takeoff mode, which did not provide an audible warning of the locked position of the steering wheels and ailerons. In the course of the takeoff run, the aircraft began to move to the right. After becoming airborne, a roll of 8 degrees occurred, which continued to increase intensively. The crew tried to counteract the banking moment by deflecting the controls to the left. The movement of the steering wheel to the left was limited by the mechanism of locking the right aileron. At 59 seconds of flight with a roll of about 90 degrees at a speed of 364 km/h the plane impacted the ground at a distance of 1893 m from the runway and broke up."
440,ACC1811,"A Embraer RJ135LR passenger jet, registered ZS-SJW and operated by SA Airlink, sustained substantial damage when it suffered a runway excursion on landing at George Airport (GRJ), South Africa. Three crew members and seven passengers sustained minor injuries.SA Airlink flight SA 8625 departed Cape Town International Airport (CPT) on a domestic scheduled flight to George. The aircraft was cleared for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach runway 11. The prevailing weather conditions at the time were overcast in light rain. The aircraft touched down in the area of the fourth landing marker. At the end of the runway veered to the right and went past the ILS localizer. The aircraft collided with eleven approach lights before it burst through the aerodrome perimeter fence, with the aircraft coming to rest in a nose down attitude on a public road.Runway 11 is a 2000 x 45 meters asphalt runway. At the time of this accident it was the first time that the George area had received a proper rain shower following the rehabilitation of the runway, which was concluded on 6 November 2009. It would appear that the application of the fog spray sealant extensively degraded the surface friction coefficient of the runway surface during wet conditions, thereby allowing the onset of aquaplaning and thereby inhibiting the application of adequate braking pressure by the anti-skid system to stop the aircraft within the certificated distance.Weather reported at the time of the accident (about 09:06 UTC / 11:06 local):FAGG 070900Z 08007KT 040V130 9999 -RA BKN080 19/18 Q1011= [Wind 080 degrees at 7 knots variable 	from to 130° ]"

The pilot and copilot departed from Des Moines Airport in weather minimums that were below the approach minimums for the departure airport. While en route, the destination airport's automated observing system continued to report weather below approach minimums, but the flight crew continued the flight. The flight crew then requested and were cleared for the instrument landing system (ILS) 31 approach and while on that approach were issued visibilities of 1,800 feet runway visual range after changing to tower frequency. During landing, the copilot told the pilot that he was not lined up with the runway. The pilot reportedly said, ""those are edge lights,"" and then realized that he was not properly lined up with the runway. The airplane then touched down beyond a normal touchdown point, about 2,800 feet down the runway, and off the left side of the runway surface. The airplane veered to the left, collapsing the nose landing gear. The company's procedures did not allow flight crew to depart to an airport that was below minimums but did allow for the flight crew, at their discretion, to perform a ""look-see"" approach to approach minimums if the weather was below minimums. The allowance of a ""look see"" approach essentially negates the procedural risk mitigation afforded by requiring approaches to be conducted only when weather was above approach minimums."
3,ACC1816,"An Antonov 24RV passenger plane, registered RA-47360, sustained substantial damage in a takeoff accident at Yakutsk Airport (YKS), Russia. Flight SYL425 to Olekminsk fell back on the runway on its belly when the engineer retracted the undercarriage prematurely."
4,ACC1817,"A Cessna 208B, N207DR, sustained substantial damage during impact with terrain following takeoff from Kwigillingok Airport, Alaska. The airline transport pilot and his seven passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was originating at the time of the accident. The intended destination was Kipnuk, Alaska, and a company flight plan had been filed.The pilot said that the takeoff was normal, but at 200 feet above the ground and in a turn, he observed a reduction in power. He moved the emergency fuel control lever forward, and power was restored. Before the sink rate could be reversed, the airplane impacted the surface of a frozen lake, and the end of the right wing was bent up. The aileron was not damaged. For safety reasons, the pilot chose to fly straight ahead for 8 miles to Kongiganak, Alaska, where the flight landed without further difficulty. The right wing required a major repair to restore it to airworthy condition.A postaccident inspection disclosed no mechanical anomalies with the engine or its accessories, and the airplane was flown to its base after the wing was repaired without any engine problems noted. A weather study by a Safety Board meteorologist determined that the area was subject to light snow showers, freezing fog and mist, and surface temperatures below freezing, all conducive to wing/airframe icing. During an interview with Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, the pilot acknowledged seeing ""a trace of ice"" on the wings."
5,ACC1818,"DHC-6 Twin Otter C-FAKB was going to make a series of positioning flights starting from Calgary, Canada, finishing in the Maldives. On 23 February 2010, C-FAKB departed from Birmingham Airport at 23:36 hrs and climbed to FL170 for a flight to Dubrovnik, Croatia. A few minutes after levelling off for the cruise, the captain noticed ""two brief flickers"" of the left generator caution light. After discussion with the co-pilot, the commander opened the DC bus tie in order to separate the two DC generator busbars electrically. This action was known to enable continued operation of both generators in circumstances where they were not properly balanced.The aircraft was ferried to Althenrhein in Switzerland for repairs on 4 March 2010. It subsequently continued to the Maldives, where it entered service with Maldivian Air Taxi as 8Q-MAD."
6,ACC1819,"A Boeing 737-247, operated by Air Tanzania, suffered substantial damage in a runway excursion accident after landing at Mwanza Airport (MWZ), Tanzania.The aircraft had departed from Dar es Salaam. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 07:22 hours the flight contacted the Mwanza Tower controller and requested information about the location of the CB cloud which had earlier been mentioned by another aircraft in the area. Mwanza Tower informed the flight that there was a CB lying north east of the airport. The relevant METAR weather information was also transmitted to the flight.The pilot subsequently requested to use runway 30 and was cleared to do so. By that time the wind was 030º/18 kt and the visibility was 10 km. The aircraft proceeded to make a visual approach to the airfield and later reported field in sight.The captain was flying the aircraft. He testified that the approach to runway 30 and touchdown were all normal. He also claimed that after reverse thrust was selected, the aircraft entered a puddle of water that adversely affected its performance and controllability and caused it to veer off the runway.After covering 305 metres on grass, the aircraft came to rest on grass off the left edge of runway 30 some 1450 metres from the threshold. About 5 metres of the right wing was protruding into the runway and the nose section was resting on the tarmac surface of a service road."

On final approach, when the landing gear was extended, the crew heard an abnormal noise and felt vibrations. They noticed that only two of the three green gear lock indicator lights were on. The unlit light was the left main gear lock indication. Five seconds later, the green hydraulic system pressure and level read zero. The crew declared an emergency and made their approach at minimum speed. During braking, the left main gear collapsed backwards. The aircraft went off the left side of the runway and came to rest on a strip of land 2000 meters past the runway threshold. The five crew members evacuated the aircraft without any problems."

The EMB-120 prepared to take off from the taxiway E2 intersection of runway 29. The flight was a training flight to revalidate the captain's command instrument rating. The supervisory pilot/training captain advised the aerodrome controller that the departure would incorporate asymmetric flight (a simulated engine failure), and was approved by the controller to perform the manoeuvre.Witnesses reported that the takeoff appeared 'normal' until a few moments after becoming airborne, when the aircraft rolled and diverged left from its takeoff path. They watched as the aircraft continued rolling left, and entered a steep nose-down attitude. The airplane impacted the ground in a right wing-low, nose-down attitude of about 65 degrees. A high intensity, fuel-fed fire that followed the collision with the ground destroyed most of the fuselage and cabin and right wing."
11,ACC1824,"The aircraft was on a flight from Mogadishu, Somalia to Wajir Airport, Kenya for a day stop. The landing in Mogadishu was uneventful. The crew tried to use flaps on their take off from Mogadishu but the flap circuit breaker (CB) kept on popping. They elected to carry out a flapless take off and subsequently a flapless landing in Wajir. On finals the crew failed to lower the landing gear.While landing in Wajir both propellers struck the runway. The aircraft slid along the runway on the fuselage for a distance of about 600 meters. It eventually came to rest approximately 1100 meters from the threshold of runway 15. The evacuation took place immediately after the aircraft came to rest; the crew escaped quickly through the door. There was no fire."

The airplane, had left Kunduz Airport (UND/OAUZ) on a domestic passenger flight PM1102 to Kabul Airport (KBL/OAKB). There were six crew members and 38 passengers on board, according to a government spokesman. Heavy fog was reported in the area.Aircrews from the Afghan National Army Air Corps (ANAAC) and ISAF located the wreckage May 19. The site is located at approximately 13,500 feet (4,100 m) in Shakar Darah district, Kabul Province. The wreckage was scattered over the mountainside.According to Al Jazeera the airline bought the plane 3 months ago from Bulgaria. Soviet Transports Fleet data indicate that YA-PIS was recently acquired by Pamir after a period of storage in Bulgaria.An inquest was held at Bradford Crown Court, U.K. because three British men were on the plane. During the inquest it was reported that an early ground proximity warning system was misunderstood by the crew, either due to language problems or because of previous false alerts. Also, the Kabul air traffic controller asked the crew to maintain their current altitude but the plane began its descent in bad weather into a mountainous area about 12 miles from Kabul."

The airplane traveled about 150 meters before coming to rest on its belly.The only navigational aid available at Cascavel is NDB."
15,ACC1828,"A Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II turboprop sustained substantial damage in a gear-up landing accident at Lanseria Airport (HLA), South Africa. The 13 passengers and two pilots were not injured.The Metro II, registered ZS-ZOC, was chartered to fly journalists to a FIFA World Cup football match in Polokwane. It took off at 08:04 from Lanseria to Polokwane. The flight crew reported that the flight was uneventful until during descent and approach to runway 05 at Polokwane. The flight crew selected the undercarriage control lever to down position. The flight crew observed the 'undercarriage unsafe' red warning light going on inside the cockpit. The 'undercarriage unsafe' red warning light indicated that the left side main landing gear was not extending. The approach was abandoned and the crew made a fly-by past the control tower. The ATC informed the flight crew that the left main landing gear doors were partially open, but the gear had not extended. The aircraft entered into a holding pattern for approximately 15 minutes, during which period the flight crew attempted to extend the landing gear. The undercarriage was recycled several times with the same indication that the left main landing gear had failed to extend. The flight crew then executed the emergency extension procedures several times, with no success. The flight crew also continued with other recommended best practice emergency procedures which included various manoeuvres to induce additional ""G"" forces on the aircraft to try and release the left main landing gear, but this was also unsuccessful. The flight crew elected to return to Lanseria because they thought that the facilities to handle emergencies of this nature were better. The flight crew continued to execute the emergency gear deployment procedures while en route to Lanseria, without success. When the aircraft was inbound approaching Lanseria, the flight crew establish contact with ATC and they were given instructions to hold over the beacon (HBV) near Hartebeespoortdam. After a while they were routed to hold over the beacon (LIV) near Lanseria, where the flight crew burned off fuel. All normal and emergency procedures used by the flight crew to extend the left main landing gear were unsuccessful. After being airborne for a period of 2.9 hours, the flight crew were given clearance by ATC to land on runway 06. The intention of the flight crew was to do a low level fly-past in front of the tower for confirmation that the left main landing gear was still not extended. The flight crew then recycled the gear up in preparation for the planned wheels up emergency landing. The flight crew made a teardrop manoeuvre to turn back in the opposite direction to approach runway 24R. During short finals overhead the threshold, prior to touchdown, the flight crew shut down both engines, feathered the propellers and switched off all the electrical power. The radios were off, thus no further communication between the flight crew and Lanseria ATC was possible. The aircraft came to a gradual stop on its lower fuselage on the centreline of the runway"
16,ACC1829,"The aircraft operated on a flight from Taiynsha to Sorochinskiy, Kazakhstan. En route the crew became lost and landed near Sarybulak village in the Aiyrtau district of the North Kazakhstan region to establish its position.

19,ACC1832,"A Conair Aviation Convair CV-580 Airtanker (""Tanker 448"") was destroyed when it crashed near Lytton, BC, Canada. Both crew members were killed in the accident. The airplane was contracted out to the B.C. Ministry of Forest and Lands as it fought a forest fire near Siwash Road, about 18 kilometres south of Lytton.The CV-580 was accompanied by a Rockwell 690 Turbo Commander, which planned and directed the fire suppression activity. This included a demonstration of the bombing run and a verbal description for the tanker crew as they circled above.The plan was for Tanker 448 to make 8 left-hand circuits, dropping 1/8 of its retardant load each time. T448 joined the circuit for its first bombing run close to the Fraser River and then proceeded south-southwest at an altitude of 3432 feet asl and a groundspeed of 140 knots. The aircraft then descended and struck three trees on a knoll at the edge of a ravine at approximately 3020 feet asl about 8 seconds before the crash. The flight crew then dropped retardant and attempted to climb away. About 3 seconds later, the aircraft entered a left-hand spin which continued for one revolution in five seconds in a steep nose-down attitude before the aircraft struck terrain 590 feet below."
20,ACC1833,"A Filair Let 410 passenger plane, registered 9Q-CCN, was destroyed in an accident near Bandundu Airport (FDU), D.R Congo. Twenty occupants died, one survived. The airplane was destroyed, there was no fire.The airplane operated on a flight to Kinshasa to Kiri, Bokoro, Semendwa, Bandundu and back to Kinshasa.The airplane reportedly came down in the village while on final approach to the airport. Media reports suggested fuel starvation, but a Filair spokesman reported that there were 150 litres of fuel in the tanks. The airplane nosed down in the village shortly before landing.According media reports the accident occurred after a contraband crocodile escaped a carry-on bag and entered the cabin. A flight attendant ran off towards the flight deck, followed by passengers. Thus the center of gravity moved too much to the front. The pilots lost control and the aircraft crashed."

22,ACC1835,"A Boeing 767-300, G-OOBK, sustained substantial damage in a hard landing accident at Bristol Airport (BRS), U.K.Flight BY519 departed from Cancún (CUN), Mexico on a scheduled flight to Bristol (BRS). There were 258 passengers and twelve crew members on board.The flight to Bristol was uneventful. Approaching the top of descent, the co-pilot carried out a briefing for the approach to runway 09, referring to the operators airport-specific (category B aerodrome) briefing as he did so. At the end of his brief, the commander emphasised points regarding the ILS glideslope on runway 09 and its possible effects during the latter part of the approach, and the longitudinal profile of the runway. The ILS glideslope is not usable below 200 ft aal.The flight crew planned to land with flap 30 and autobrake 4 because of the length of the runway. Shortly after the top of descent, the flight crew obtained the ATIS which stated that runway 09 was in use, the wind was from 100° at 10 kt, visibility 1,400 m in rain and mist, with RVR in excess of 1,500 m, and cloud scattered at 100 ft aal and broken at 400 ft aal.As the aircraft descended through FL300, the commander decided that, given the weather conditions at Bristol, he should carry out the landing himself, and took control.During the approach the commander commented that there was ""a surprising amount of turbulence"". The aircraft was established on the ILS for runway 09 with the autothrottle and autopilot engaged. The target approach speed was set to 139 kt on the Mode Control Panel (MCP) and at 1,600 ft above airfield level (aal), the aircraft was fully configured for landing, with flap set at 30° and autobrake four selected. The aircraft was stabilised on the glide path at an average descent rate of about 680 ft/min (~11 ft/s), although there were fluctuations in airspeed, angle of attack and normal acceleration, indicative of turbulence.As the aircraft descended through 200 ft aal, the autothrottle and autopilot were manually disconnected. The airspeed was 141 kt at the time and the wind calculated by the FMC was from 138° at 25 kt. At approximately 120 ft aal, there was a slight increase in engine EPR and the airspeed also increased from 138 kt to 146 kt. At about the same time, the aircraft pitch attitude increased from 2.5° to just less than 4° nose up. This was followed by a momentary nose down input on the control column and a coincident reduction in engine EPR.At a height of about 35 ft (just over three seconds before touchdown), the pitch attitude was just less than 1° nose up and airspeed was 142 kt. The descent rate was about 600 ft/min (10 ft/sec), with the wind, calculated by the FMC, from 116° at 20 kt. Aft control column was then applied and over the next three seconds the pitch attitude progressively increased to 3.5° nose up . However, there was only a gradual reduction in the rate of descent before the aircraft touched down on the main landing gear, registering a peak normal load of 2.05g. Coincident with the touchdown of the main landing gear, a momentary longitudinal deceleration of -0.27g was recorded. Both the commander and co-pilot were thrown forward during the touchdown, which resulted in the commander inadvertently moving the control column forward, to a nose down position. The spoilers also started to deploy at this time. The aircraft then became 'light' on its main landing gear whilst also de-rotating in pitch at about three degrees per second. At a nose down pitch attitude of just less than 1°, a normal load of 2.05g was recorded as the nose gear contacted the runway. The aircraft then rapidly pitched up and down, from between 3° nose up to just less than 0.5° nose down (indicating bouncing of the nose gear), before the aircraft eventually settled on the landing gear.Seven seconds after the initial touchdown, the thrust reversers were deployed, and the control column, which had remained in a forward nose down position since the initial touchdown, was progressively moved aft. Manual braking was then applied before the aircraft was taxied from the runway."

The airplane had arrived after a cargo flight from Villavicencio. During landing rollout on runway 04 the airplane lost hydraulic pressure. The pilot shut down the engines and unlocked the tail wheel. He attempted to steer the plane using the tail wheel. The DC-3 swung 90 degrees and ran into a trench, located 20 metres from the runway. The right hand wing sustained serious structural damage."
25,ACC1838,"A Cessna 501 Citation I/SP corporate jet, registered G-VUEM, was damaged beyond repair in a landing accident at Birmingham International Airport (BHX), U.K.. Both crew members survived. The airplane was parked at Liverpool Airport on the accident day. The original objective was to fly to Belfast City Airport, collect a transplant organ, and take it to Cambridge Airport. However, on the arrival at Belfast the transfer was no longer required, so the crew members were given a new task to fly to Belfast International Airport (BFS) and collect an organ to carry to Birmingham Airport (BHX).The aircraft departed Belfast-BFS at 14:50 with the co-pilot as pilot flying. The flight was uneventful and the aircraft was given a radar vector to intercept the ILS for a straight-in approach to runway 15 at Birmingham. The runway 15 ILS course is 149°M. The autopilot was engaged and the aircraft was flying on a track of 135°M, 13 nm from the touchdown zone and at a groundspeed of 254 kt, when it crossed the localiser centreline. The aircraft then turned right onto a corrective track but once again passed through the localiser course. Further corrections were made and the aircraft passed through the localiser once more before becoming established at 5 nm. The co-pilot later reported that, because the autopilot was not capturing the localiser, he had disconnected it and flown the approach manually. When the aircraft was at 10 nm, the radar controller broadcast a message advising of the presence of a fog bank on final approach and giving RVRs of 1,400 m at touchdown and in excess of 1,500 m at both the mid-point and stop end. The airfield was sighted by the commander during the approach but not by the co-pilot. A handover to the tower frequency was made at around 8 nm. When the aircraft was at 6 nm, landing clearance was given and acknowledged. The tower controller then advised the aircraft that there was a fog bank over the airfield boundary, together with the information that the touchdown RVR was 1,400 m. The commander responded, saying: ""We've got one end of the runway"". The aircraft was correctly on the localiser and the glideslope at 4 nm. The Decision Altitude (DA) of 503 ft amsl (200 ft aal) for the approach was written on a bug card mounted centrally above the glareshield. Both pilots recollected that the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) calls of ""500 above"" and ""100 above"" DA were made by the commander. However, neither pilot could recall a call of 'decision' or 'go-around' being made. At between 1.1 nm and 0.9 nm, and 400 ft to 300 ft aal, the aircraft turned slightly to the right, onto a track of 152°M. This track was maintained until the aircraft struck the glideslope antenna to the right of the runway some 30 seconds later. The aircraft came to rest in an upright position on the grass with a fire on the left side. The co-pilot evacuated through the main cabin door, which is located on the left side of the fuselage, and suffered flash burns as he passed through the fire. The commander was trapped in the cockpit for a time."

30,ACC1843,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan passenger plane, registered N715HE, sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at Kipnuk Airport, AK (KPN), USA. All four passengers and two crew members were not injured. The airplane operated on Hageland flight 161 from Bethel Airport, AK (BET) to Kipnuk Airport, AK (KPN).Following a normal approach to runway 33, the captain landed long to avoid a bump in the runway. As the airplane touched down on the runway, he applied brakes and moved the propeller into beta. During the landing roll, he realized the airplane was still traveling fast, and he did not have enough area to abort the landing, so he applied maximum brakes. The airplane continued off the departure end (north side) of runway 33, and impacted a ditch, which resulted in the airplane coming to rest right wing and nose low. The captain said that at the time of the accident, the runway contained packed snow and ice.Examination of the airplane by the captain revealed that the right wing was bent upwards about 3 to 4 feet inboard from the wingtip."

On seeing Union Island, he assumed that it was Canouan and did not confirm this with the GPS distance.On seeing the high terrain to the west of the airport in Union Island the pilot decided to land from the east; hence his request to the Canouan ATC (STSC) to land on Runway 31. It was not until the aircraft was on short final approach that the pilots observed that the runway was 26 (the runway heading in Union Island (TVSU)) and not Runway 31 (the runway heading in Canouan TVSC)). The captain stated in his report that at this point, he did not believe that it was possible to execute a go-around due to the hills in his flight path.As a result of landing on the reduced runway length available at Union Island (TVSU), in addition to the tailwind component of approximately 10 kts, the aircraft was unable to stop and having veered off to the left, came to rest on the southern side of the end of Runway 26 striking the perimeter fence."
36,ACC1849,"A Bombardier Challenger 300 corporate jet sustained damage in a runway excursion accident at Iqaluit Airport, NU (YFB), Canada. There were no injuries, and aircraft damage was limited to the nose and main landing gear, which was subsequently replaced.The flight departed Long Beach, CA (LGB) en route to Milan, Italy, with a planned fuel stop in Iqaluit (YFB), Canada. The flight time to Iqaluit was 5 hours and 36 minutes at a cruise altitude of 41 000 feet. The flight en route was uneventful; the outside temperature at the cruising altitude was approximately -60°C.The first officer was the pilot flying. An ILS/DME approach to runway 35 at Iqaluit was carried out with the autopilot on. The reported surface winds were within the aircraft limitations for a right crosswind with a light tailwind component. A reference speed (VREF) of 114 knots was calculated. The before-landing checklist items were completed 3 miles prior to the final approach fix. The autopilot was disconnected, and the aircraft crossed the threshold at a speed of about 118 knots.The aircraft touched down approximately 10 feet to the right of the centreline at 21:00. Once the nose wheel contacted the runway, the aircraft veered to the right. The crew applied full left rudder and left brake while selecting left nose steering with the tiller. Thrust reversers were also selected, but the aircraft continued to pull to the right. The aircraft departed the runway 4300 feet from the threshold and came to rest in packed snow 100 feet from the runway edge lights. The nose landing gear (NLG) came to rest in snow reaching the top of the wheel height, and the main landing gear (MLG) came to rest in snow reaching half the wheel height."
37,ACC1850,"A Beech Super King Air 200, N849BM, impacted terrain following a loss of control during takeoff from Long Beach Airport, CA. The commercial pilot and four passengers were fatally injured; a fifth passenger was seriously injured. The airplane was destroyed.Witnesses reported that the airplanes takeoff ground roll appeared to be normal. Shortly after the airplane lifted off, it stopped climbing and yawed to the left. Several witnesses heard abnormal sounds, which they attributed to propeller blade angle changes. The airplanes flight path deteriorated to a left skid and its airspeed began to slow. The airplanes left bank angle increased to between 45 and 90 degrees, and its nose dropped to a nearly vertical attitude. Just before impact, the airplanes bank angle and pitch began to flatten out. The airplane had turned left about 100 degrees when it impacted the ground about 1,500 feet from the midpoint of the 10,000-foot runway. A fire then erupted, which consumed the fuselage."
38,ACC1851,"An Airbus A-300-600F airplane, N173UP, registered to United Parcel Service, and operated as flight 797, a domestic cargo flight from El Paso, Texas, struck its tail during a go-around following an attempted landing in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The captain was the pilot flying and the takeoff, climb and cruise portion of the flight was uneventful. Prior to landing, the captain conducted the approach briefing, indicating that they would conduct a visual approach to runway 26, the gusty winds required a wind additive to the approach speed and would go-around if the approach was not stabilized.On final approach, the local controller cleared the flight to land and reported the winds were 310 degrees at 16 knots. The flight crew stated that at 1000 feet AGL the landing checklist was complete, the airplane was fully configured for landing and the approach speed was set to 132 knots (Vref + 5). Recorder data indicated that during the final approach, the autothrottle was disconnected about 800 feet above the ground and the airspeed decreased to as low as 129 knots but did not go below Vref (127 knots). The first officer (FO) stated that he called out the low airspeed and adjusted the target airspeed from 132 to 134 knots. The captain increased power during the approach but the airspeed remained slightly below Vapp until landing. Pitch attitude on final approach was stable at about 5 to 6 degrees nose up. The pitch attitude at touchdown was about 7 degrees and the airplane touched down first on the right main landing gear (MLG) and then on the left MLG. The flight crew stated that they felt that the airplane bounced and both called for a go around simultaneously. About one second after the initial touchdown, the ground spoilers began to deploy, followed by an increase in pitch in the next two seconds from 4.2 degrees to 12.7 degrees. Thrust levers advanced to near maximum thrust about one second after the left MLG touched down and as the ground spoilers were in transit. Pitch attitude continued to increase to more than 14 degrees while the airplane was still on the ground. Neither flight crewmember was aware of a tail strike until the captain discovered damage to the airplane during the post flight inspection.The tail strike resulted in aft fuselage skin cracks and numerous sheared rivets, internal structural damage to the frames, a cracked support bracket, buckled floor beam, buckled main cargo deck floor panels, and buckled stringers."
39,ACC1852,"A Cessna Citation II jet plane went missing during a survey flight out of Korla, China, with three crew members on board.The airplane took off around 16:00 from Korla Airport, heading north on a survey mission above the Tianshan mountains. Search missions in that region failed to locate the plane and the search was called off."
40,ACC1853,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-3T Turbo Otter was destroyed in an accident 56 km northeast of Mayo, YT, Canada. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. The wheel-ski equipped aircraft was being utilized in support of mineral exploration activities, to transport building materials, fuel, and winter camp supplies from Mayo, Yukon, to winter airstrips located at Withers Lake and Rackla River, Yukon. On the accident flight, the aircraft was transporting a load of twelve 6-inch by 6-inch wood timbers, each 16 feet long, and 2 barrels of jet fuel.The accident flight departed Mayo at 14:48 under visual flight rules (VFR). Some nineteen minutes later the aircraft experienced a catastrophic in-flight breakup. Aircraft wreckage came down on a remote, snow-covered hillside at about 4300 feet above sea level."
41,ACC1854,"A Fugro Aviation Canada CASA C-212-CC40, C-FDKM, was destroyed in a forced landing accident in Saskatoon, SK, Canada. One of the three crew members was killed.The airplane departed Saskatoon Airport, SK (YXE) at 15:03 for a geophysical survey flight to the east of Saskatoon. At about 18:14 the aircraft experienced a shudder from the right engine just before it smoothly spooled down. The propeller rotation slowed and the aircraft yawed. The right engine torque fell below 20%. The crew confirmed that the right engine had lost power. Altitude at the time was 2300 feet and the 2 survey sensors were deployed behind and below the aircraft.The captain set maximum power on the left engine and the crew commenced to shut down the right hand engine. As the first officer had more experience on the aircraft than the captain, the pilots agreed to let the FO continue as pilot flying. The captain would continue with the checklists and radio communications.At 18:17 the captain notified the Saskatoon control tower of the situation with a MAYDAY call, advising they had lost power on one engine and were returning to Saskatoon. By 18:18, the aircraft had climbed to 2600 feet asl and accelerated to about 99 KIAS, and the pilots had instructed the survey equipment operator to recover the survey sensors. The survey equipment operator got up to do so. The recovery process took 4 to 5 minutes. At 18:25, the flight reached 3100 feet asl (about 1400 agl), the maximum altitude following the right engine power loss.By 18:27, airspeed was about 105 to 110 KIAS, and both pilots had visual contact with the runway. The FO's plan was to fly a high steep approach, and he had not yet reduced the left engine power lever setting for the approach. The tower cleared the flight to land on runway 27.Meanwhile the fuel level left tank or fuel pressure left engine annunciators had illuminated, along with the master caution light. Neither pilot observed these annunciations.At about 18:28, airspeed was 105 KIAS or greater when the left engine smoothly lost power with no surging. The captain observed the torque indicator smoothly and rapidly decreasing from 100% to 20% within a couple of seconds. The airplane decelerated and yawed to the left. The altitude was 3000 feet asl (about 1300 feet agl). Both pilots immediately concluded the flight would not reach the runway, and the captain pointed out a large street to the FO as a feasible forced landing site and the FO concurred. Neither pilot could see any better alternative. The left hand prop was then feathered.The FO maintained control of the aircraft throughout the descent. Airspeed slowed initially to 100 KIAS and later to 90 KIAS. The goal was to control the descent and impact, with a minimum airspeed of 90 KIAS to prevent a departure from controlled flight. The pilots observed traffic on the road. They revised the intended touchdown site to the grass beside 51st Street, to the right of the traffic and light poles and the left of what they perceived as a frangible fence.Late in the descent the pilots identified that the fence was actually a noise abatement wall. The FO concluded that the flight could not be extended beyond the noise abatement wall and advised the other crew members. The aircraft landed astride the wall at 90 KIAS. When the aircraft came to a stop, the captain turned off the batteries and the master switch and pressed the cockpit engine fire extinguisher buttons."
42,ACC1855,"A Gulfstream G650 jet was damaged beyond repair in a takeoff accident at Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW). The two pilots and the two flight test engineers were fatally injured.The accident occurred during a planned one-engine-inoperative (OEI) takeoff when a stall on the right outboard wing produced a rolling moment that the flight crew was not able to control, which led to the right wingtip contacting the runway and the airplane departing the runway from the right side. After departing the runway, the airplane impacted a concrete structure and an airport weather station, resulting in extensive structural damage and a postcrash fire that completely consumed the fuselage and cabin interior.The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation of this accident found that the airplane stalled while lifting off the ground. As a result, the NTSB examined the role of ""ground effect"" on the airplane's performance. Ground effect refers to changes in the airflow over the airplane resulting from the proximity of the airplane to the ground. Ground effect results in increased lift and reduced drag at a given angle of attack (AOA) as well as a reduction in the stall AOA. In preparing for the G650 field performance flight tests, Gulfstream considered ground effect when predicting the airplane's takeoff performance capability but overestimated the in ground effect stall AOA. Consequently, the airplane's AOA threshold for stick shaker (stall warning) activation and the corresponding pitch limit indicator (on the primary flight display) were set too high, and the flight crew received no tactile or visual warning before the actual stall occurred.The accident flight was the third time that a right outboard wing stall occurred during G650 flight testing. Gulfstream did not determine (until after the accident) that the cause of two previous uncommanded roll events was a stall of the right outboard wing at a lower-than-expected AOA. (Similar to the accident circumstances, the two previous events occurred during liftoff; however, the right wingtip did not contact the runway during either of these events.) If Gulfstream had performed an in-depth aerodynamic analysis of these events shortly after they occurred, the company could have recognized before the accident that the actual in-ground-effect stall AOA was lower than predicted.During field performance testing before the accident, the G650 consistently exceeded target takeoff safety speeds (V2). V2 is the speed that an airplane attains at or before a height above the ground of 35 feet with one engine inoperative. Gulfstream needed to resolve these V2 exceedances because achieving the planned V2 speeds was necessary to maintain the airplane's 6,000-foot takeoff performance guarantee (at standard sea level conditions). If the G650 did not meet this takeoff performance guarantee, then the airplane could only operate on longer runways. However, a key assumption that Gulfstream used to develop takeoff speeds was flawed and resulted in V2 speeds that were too low and takeoff distances that were longer than anticipated.Rather than determining the root cause for the V2 exceedance problem, Gulfstream attempted to reduce the V2 speeds and the takeoff distances by modifying the piloting technique used to rotate the airplane for takeoff. Further, Gulfstream did not validate the speeds using a simulation or physics-based dynamic analysis before or during field performance testing. If the company had done so, then it could have recognized that the target V2 speeds could not be achieved even with the modified piloting technique. In addition, the difficulties in achieving the target V2 speeds were exacerbated in late March 2011 when the company reduced the target pitch angle for some takeoff tests without an accompanying increase in the takeoff speeds.Gulfstream maintained an aggressive schedule for the G650 flight test program so that the company could obtain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification by the third quarter of 2011. The schedule pressure, combined with inadequately developed organizational processes for technical oversight and safety management, led to a strong focus on keeping the program moving and a reluctance to challenge key assumptions and highlight anomalous airplane behavior during tests that could slow the pace of the program. These factors likely contributed to key errors, including the development of unachievable takeoff speeds, as well as the superficial review of the two previous uncommanded roll events, which allowed the company's overestimation of the in-ground-effect stall AOA to remain undetected."
43,ACC1856,"A Cessna 208B cargo plane, registered N208TF, sustained substantial damage in an accident at El Paso International Airport, TX (ELP). As the commercial pilot prepared for the evening cargo flight, the winds were reported as being strong and gusting. The pilot reported that he radioed the control tower for his flight clearance and the current wind conditions. Since the wind was higher than previously reported, the pilot told the tower that he would wait, before taxing further. The pilot added that after deciding to delay the flight and before he could shut down the airplane, a large gust of wind pushed the airplanes nose left and lifted the left wing. The airplanes propeller and right wing impacted the ground, bending the airplanes right wing. At 1851 the automated weather reporting station, located on the airport, reported the wind at 270 degrees at 36 knots gusting to 48 knots."
44,ACC1857,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan passenger plane, registered VT-NES, sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at Lengpui Airport (AJL), India.The aircraft was operating a non scheduled flight from Imphal to Lengpui with ten persons on board including the pilot. The aircraft took off normally from Imphal at 10:00 hrs and subsequently came in contact with ATC Lengpui at 10:23hrs. ATC Lengpui conveyed the latest available weather with visibility as 4500 m. The pilot requested special VFR which was approved by the tower controller. Visibility further dropped to 2000 m and the pilot preferred to enter a holding pattern, in coordination with ATC at 10 miles maintaining visual separation with terrain at an altitude of 6500 feet. The pilot thereafter without any communication with ATC reported downwind for runway 17 and subsequently reported for final. When the aircraft reported final, the controller after sighting the aircraft gave the landing clearance with wind as calm and runway surface wet. The aircraft touched down well past the threshold at a high speed with a remaining distance in which it was impossible to stop the aircraft. It climbed a 10 feet high platform constructed to install the Localizer antenna at the end of runway 17. As the speed of the aircraft was high, it continued past the localizer platform and fell in a ravine approximately 60 feet deep.All 9 passengers and the pilot escaped unhurt. There was no fire."
45,ACC1858,"A Saab 340A passenger plane, registered LV-CEJ, was destroyed when it crashed 20 km north of Prahuaniyeu, Argentina. The 19 passengers and three crew members on board did not survive the accident.The airplane operated on SOL Líneas Aéreas flight 5428 from Córdoba (COR) to Mendoza (MDZ), Neuquén (NQN) and Comodoro Rivadavia (CRD). The flight departed Neuquén at 20:05 for the final leg of the flight. The aircraft climbed to FL190. After flying for 24 minutes, the pilot levelled the aircraft at 17800 ft, and remained at this level for approximately 9 minutes.When flying at FL179, the aircraft began to pick up ice. The copilot radioed air traffic control for permission to descent. The flight was then cleared down to FL140. However, while descending the crew members commented on the growing ice accretion on the wind shield and wings. By the time the aircraft had reached FL140, the icing conditions were severe. The aircraft flew for approximately two minutes with a straight and level flight attitude, increasing the accumulation of ice.The airspeed dropped until the airplane stalled. The pilots attempted to regain control of the plane, but failed. The airplane impacted terrain and burned."
46,ACC1859,"An Eclipse 500 jet, N168TT, sustained substantial damage during a go-around at the Nome Airport, Alaska. The commercial pilot and the sole passenger were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was in effect. The flight originated from the Anadyr Airport, Russia.The pilot indicated that, prior to the accident flight, the wing flaps had failed, but he decided to proceed with the flight contrary to the Airplane Flight Manual guidance. While conducting a no-flap approach to the airport, he decided that his airspeed was too fast to land, and he initiated a go-around. During the go-around, the airplane continued to descend, and the fuselage struck the runway. The pilot was able to complete the go-around, and realized that he had not extended the landing gear. He lowered the landing gear, and landed the airplane uneventfully. He elected to remain overnight at the airport due to fatigue. The next day, he decided to test fly the airplane. During the takeoff roll, the airplane had a severe vibration, and he aborted the takeoff. During a subsequent inspection, an aviation mechanic discovered that the center wing carry-through cracked when the belly skid pad deflected up into a stringer during the gear-up landing."

51,ACC1864,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan was destroyed when it crashed on takeoff from Pukatawagan Airport, MB (XPK), Canada. There were eight passengers on board and one pilot. One passenger was killed in the accident.During the takeoff run on runway 33, the aircraft's airspeed indicator initially rose as the aircraft accelerated and its nose wheel lifted off the runway. The flaps were set to 20° and the engine produced rated power. During the takeoff roll, the aircraft encountered several soft spots near the taxiway intersection. The pilot applied rearward pressure on the control yoke and one or both main wheels briefly lifted off the runway, but the airspeed stopped increasing and the aircraft did not remain airborne. The pilot rejected the takeoff with an estimated 600 feet of runway remaining. The pilot selected engine power to idle, reverse propeller thrust, and flaps to 0° to maximize braking traction. The aircraft continued past the end of runway 33. The aircraft was travelling at a relatively low speed but the pilot was unable to stop before the aircraft dropped off the steep slope and proceeded down an embankment before coming to rest in a ravine. As a result of the impact, the aircraft was damaged and its fuel system was compromised. A post-crash fire ensued. The airplane was owned by Beaver Air Service, which flies under the name Missinippi Airways."

The sky was clear with good visibility and wind 8-10 knots from west and south west.During the training five landings and takeoffs were made simulating different conditions of flight. All these landings and takeoffs were made inside the lagoon except the last landing where the crew decided to land on open water outside the lagoon. The crew were simulating a tail wind/single engine landing. As per the crew, the aircraft initial touch down was smooth. However, they stroke a wave which made the aircraft bounce foe about 20 feet. With the low power aircraft hit the water again with great impact, resulting multiple float attachments to break. Both front and main spreader bars broke and floats rose up, twisted and hitting the bottom engine cowlings. Propeller cuts were found on front of both floats.

59,ACC1872,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan airplane, N207DR, and a Cessna T207A Turbo Stationair 7 airplane, N73789, collided in midair, approximately 14 km north of Nightmute, Alaska. Both airplanes were being operated as visual flight rules (VFR) charter flights in visual meteorological conditions when the accident occurred. The Cessna 208B was operated by Grant Aviation and the Cessna 207 was operated by Ryan Air. The sole occupant of the Cessna 208B sustained fatal injuries. The sole occupant of the Cessna 207 was uninjured. Both airplanes sustained substantial damage during the midair collision. After the collision, the Cessna 208B descended, uncontrolled, and impacted tundra-covered terrain. A postcrash fire consumed most of the wreckage. The Cessna 207 was further damaged during a forced landing on tundra-covered terrain. Both airplanes were based at the Bethel Airport, Alaska. The Cessna 208B departed from the Toksook Bay Airport (OOK) about 13:25, and VFR company flight following procedures were in effect for the flight to Bethel. The Cessna 207 departed from the Tununak Airport, Alaska, about 13:15, and VFR company flight following procedures were in effect for the return flight to Bethel.Both pilots had a close personal relationship. After takeoff from Tununak, the pilot of the Cessna 207 talked with the pilot of the Cessna 208B on a prearranged, discreet radio frequency, and the two agreed to rendezvous for the flight back to Bethel. She said that while in cruise level flight at 1,200 feet msl, en route to Bethel, the pilot of the Cessna 208B flew his airplane along the left side of her airplane, and they continued to talk via radio. She said that the pilot of the Cessna 208B then unexpectedly and unannounced climbed his airplane above, and overtop of her airplane. She immediately told the pilot of the 208B that she could not see him, and she was concerned about where he was. She said the 208B pilot then said, in part: ""Whatever you do, don't pull up."" Moments later, the next thing she recalls was the 208B's impact with her airplane's right wing.The 207 pilot reported that after the impact, she saw the 208B pass underneath her airplane, and it began a gradual descent, which steepened as the airplane continued to the left and away from her airplane. She said that she told the pilot of the 208B that she thought she was going to crash. The pilot of the 208B stated that he also thought he was going to crash. She said that she watched as the 208B continued to descend, then it entered a steep, vertical, nose down descent, before it collided with the ground. She said a postcrash fire started instantaneously upon impact. The 207 pilot said that while struggling to maintain control of her airplane, she was unable to maintain altitude, and she selected an area of rolling, tundra-covered terrain as a forced landing site. She said that during the emergency descent, she had limited roll control, and the airplane's stall horn was on during the entire emergency approach. The airplane touched down on the soft terrain, and the nose landing gear collapsed. The Cessna 208B's severed vertical stabilizer and rudder assemblies were found about one-half mile west of the main wreckage site, and along the two airplanes' reported flight route. A large portion of the Cessna 207's right aileron was found near the 208's rudder and stabilizer."
60,ACC1873,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan I was destroyed when it crashed in the Yahukimo District, Indonesia. Both crew members were killed.The airplane was being operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Wamena Airport to Kenyam Aerodrome in Papua, Indonesia. The flight was being conducted under visual flight rules (VFR) and the pilot reported to ATC that the planned altitude was 9,500 feet.On board the aircraft were two pilots, a manifested load of diesel drums and grocery items, and a non-manifested load of 25 bags of rice weighing 827 lb (375 kg). The takeoff weight, based on the manifested cargo and the additional load of rice was estimated by the investigation to be 9,681 lb (4,391 Kg) which was 619 lb (281 Kg) above the certificated maximum takeoff weight. Also, the aircraft Centre of Gravity (C of G) was outside the certificated C of G envelope.The aircraft took off from Wamena runway 15 at 12:17 local time. The aircraft was then flown along a track toward Kenyam which was consistent with the route used by other company pilots and previously flown by the pilot in command. The additional loading contributed to a reduced rate of climb during the flight which resulted in the aircraft being below 10,000 ft as it approached the high terrain. This altitude was 1,500 ft lower than the altitude specified in the operator's route guide for operations between Wamena and Kenyam, and lower than the altitude flown by other company pilots when operating in the area, including three other flights on the day of the accident which overflew the high terrain between 11,200 and 12,500 ft.At 12:29:43, as the aircraft approached the high terrain at an altitude of 9,538 ft, the airspeed commenced decreasing which was accompanied by the average rate of climb increasing to about 390 fpm. It is probable that the pilots recognized the proximity of the terrain and attempted to improve the aircraft's angle of climb by decelerating towards the best angle of climb speed of 72 kts. The recorded data showed that 31 seconds after the airspeed started to decrease, the engine power varied with a maximum engine torque of 1,675 ft/lb being recorded at 12:30:30 with changes in the other engine parameters being consistent with a selection of a higher power setting. This is likely to have been associated with the pilot's attempts to improve terrain clearance.The recorded data then showed the aircraft in a descending right turn for about 6 seconds. The altitude reduced over a period of 4 seconds from 9,865 ft to 9,728 ft at an average rate of descent of about 2,000 fpm. This turn was likely to have been initiated to either avoid cloud or improve terrain clearance. The aircraft subsequently commenced to roll to the left at 12:30:35 with the left roll continuing for the following 14 seconds. It was likely that the left turn was initiated to avoid either cloud or terrain. During the left turn, the angle of bank reached a maximum value of 46° and the aircraft descended from 9,728 ft to 9,045 ft at a high rate of descent. The airspeed also increased from 92 kts to 122 kts during the descent. The engine power was reduced to idle soon after the aircraft commenced descending which was most likely due to the handling pilot attempting to recover from the high descent rate and increasing airspeed. The recorded data indicated that three EGPWS alerts activated during the descent.The aircraft had stopped descending at 12:30:50 and had commenced climbing with a reducing left angle of bank when the airplane impacted terrain at an elevation of 9,100 feet."

62,ACC1875,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300 float plane sustained substantial damage when it crashed in a street next to Yellowknife Waterdrome, NT, Canada. Both pilots were killed and five of the seven passengers were injured.The airplane had departed from Thor Lake, NT at 12:48 on a flight to the Yellowknife Waterdome. The first officer (FO) was acting as the pilot flying (PF) in the right seat, and the captain was the pilot not flying (PNF) in the left seat. The crew obtained weather information from the Yellowknife Airport automatic terminal information service (ATIS) and briefed their planned approach to the waterdrome. When joining a left base for landing, C-GARW was advised by the Yellowknife Airport control tower, located about 6 nautical miles (11 km) west of the waterdrome, that the winds at the airport were variable from the southwest at 10 knots, gusting to 30 knots. Due to the 2 to 3-foot waves (rollers) on the lake, the crew planned their approach so as to land close to the shore and to avoid entering the passage between the shore and Jolliffe Island. The captain also advised that the airspeed should be kept above 80 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), which is 10 KIAS above the normal approach speed of 70 KIAS, for the full-flap (37.5°) approach and landing. During the approach, the captain cautioned the FO twice about the airspeed getting too low. The aircraft touched down in the intended landing area and bounced, then contacted the water a second time with the right float first. The float dug in, and the aircraft yawed to the right, turning towards the shore. The stall warning sounded for about 0.3 seconds.Without declaring that he was taking control, the captain placed his right hand on the power lever over the FO's left hand and initiated full power for a go-around. C-GARW lifted off in a nose-high, right-wing-low attitude, in a right turn that continued at a low altitude over the shore and toward the buildings in Old Town, Yellowknife. At this time, the captain called for the flaps to be raised to 20°, to which the FO responded. However, the flaps were not moved before impact. The right wing contacted power lines, causing the aircraft to rotate to a nose-down attitude. The bottom of the floats then contacted the side of a 3-storey office building. C-GARW dropped to the ground on its nose section, then cart-wheeled to its left into an adjacent parking lot. The stall warning intermittently activated throughout the go-around until just prior to impact.The total elapsed time from the initiation of the go-around to the command that flaps be set to 20° was about 4 seconds, and, from that command to the final impact, about 6 seconds. The maximum altitude gained was approximately 50 feet above ground.Numerous witnesses to the accident were on scene immediately to assist in evacuating the passengers. There was no fire, although a considerable amount of fuel was spilled."

74,ACC1887,"At 09:39 hours UTC on 18 December 2011, an M-28 Skytruck, operated by the U.S. Air Force, departed Kandahar Air Base, Afghanistan on a mission to pick up four passengers at Qalat, Afghanistan, transport them to Walan Rabat short takeoff and landing zone, transport two additional personnel from Walan Rabat back to Qalat, then return to Kandahar Air Base. The aircraft and crew were assigned or attached to the 318th Special Operations Squadron, 27th Special Operations Wing at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, and were deployed to the 318th Expeditionary Special Operations Squadron at Kandahar Air Base, Afghanistan.After an uneventful stop at Qalat to onload four passengers and their bags, the crew flew a 20-minute leg to Walan Rabat. Surface winds at Walan Rabat were 190 degrees at 14 knots gusting to 17 knots, 30 degrees off a direct tailwind for runway 34. Because the landing zone has a three percent upslope for runway 34, and a 1,500-foot mountain exists 1,5 miles to the north, the pilot elected to land with a tailwind on runway 34, the preferred landing direction.Walan Rabat Landing Zone is a 1,756-foot long, 31-foot wide, semi-prepared dirt strip with poorly defined boundaries. The landing zone was marked with AMP-3 markings, commonly called a ""box-and-one"" with colored panels. The pilot consulted a wind component chart and incorrectly calculated the tailwind component, mistakenly believing it was within the allowable limit for landing the M-28. The pilot flew a shallow 2,5-3 degree approach due to the upsloping landing zone. At approximately 1,000 feet short of the landing zone, the pilot visually acquired the AMP-3 markings and landed the aircraft at 10:32 UTC. After a firmer than normal landing, the aircraft veered to the right and departed the prepared surface.The nose gear encountered uneven terrain and collapsed, causing the aircraft to flip tailover-nose. The crew and passengers then egressed the aircraft through the copilots window. There were no serious injuries to crew or passengers."
75,ACC1888,"A Let L-410UVP-E9 passenger plane sustained substantial damage in a runway excursion accident at Tembo, Kenya. The four passengers and two pilots survived.The aircraft left Mombasa-Moi International Airport to drop and pick up passengers at several airstrips in the Masai Mara game reserve. The crew had a day stop in Olkiombo Airstrip before beginning their usual pick-up routine before returning back to Mombasa. The crew testified to have topped up 200 litres of fuel before departing Olkiombo for Kicha Tembo airstrip where they were to pick up four passengers and another 15 passengers from Musiara Airstrip. The first officer reported to have put one large bag at the nose luggage compartment while the rest of the lighter luggage was place at the rear luggage compartment.On the take off roll on Tembo's runway 08, the first officer, who was Pilot Flying, reported to have hit a bump half way down the runway and bounced. The aircraft hit a second bump and again went airborne prematurely. At that moment the crew reported to have heard a continuous stall warning horn. The pilot flying recalled the pilot monitoring retarding the throttles, an action which made him realize that they were aborting take off. The pilot monitoring reported that there was a bit of tug on the controls between the two of them with the first officer (PF) pushing the control column down for a nose down attitude and the captain (PNF) trying to ease the force on the control column. With very little runway length left, the aircraft veered to the right at the end of the runway and came to a stop approximately 300 meters from the threshold of runway 26.The nose gear assembly was ripped off by the rough terrain and the rest of the aircraft ploughed through the grass for another approximately 10 meters. The aircraft front belly section was severely damaged."

79,ACC1892,"The accident occurred during a touch and go at Naval Air Station Key West. During the takeoff just prior to the aircraft becoming airborne, the Loadmaster, who was seated in the rear of the cargo compartment, heard an electrical buzzing sound and observed an orange jet-like flame shoot across the cargo ramp from left to right at floor level. He then unbuckled his harness and was reaching for the fire extinguisher when an expansive orange fireball erupted, causing him to protect his head with his jacket. Once the fireball receded, he proceeded forward and alerted the crew to the fire while calling for the takeoff to be aborted.Concurrently, the aircraft had just become airborne and reached 10 feet above the runway. With sufficient runway remaining, the Flying Pilot landed straight ahead and aggressively stopped the aircraft while the Non-Flying Pilot notified ATC.

81,ACC1894,"A Beechcraft 1900C was damaged in a landing accident at Blue River Airport, BC, Canada. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The occurrence flight was chartered by a travel agency on behalf of a wilderness adventure ski lodge. It was a regularly occurring charter flight between Vancouver and Blue River, BC, Canada.The travel agent verbally passed weather information to the flight crew. The captain understood that the runway had been plowed the previous day, and that the weather had been good that morning in Blue River.Before departing Vancouver, the flight crew had also obtained official weather data from regular flight planning sources. It was noted that although current conditions at Blue River were good, a weather system was moving northbound, and conditions in the area of Kelowna, Kamloops (CYKA) (the alternate), and Blue River would begin to deteriorate. As the flight progressed, the ski lodge radio room operator overheard the flight crew discussing weather conditions with a local helicopter pilot on the ATF as the flight overflew Blue River, but the operator did not have any direct contact with the flight. The crew was satisfied with the information received from the helicopter pilot regarding local weather.Because the Blue River aerodrome does not have a published instrument approach procedure, the intention was to fly over the aerodrome and proceed under visual flight rules (VFR) into the aerodrome. The flight progressed as planned until the aircraft passed overhead Blue River at the lowest useable IFR altitude, and the pilot was not able to descend under VFR into Blue River.The pilot then climbed back up to an enroute IFR altitude and continued to Valemount Airport under IFR. After conducting the IFR approach into Valemount and finding the weather suitable for flight under VFR, the aircraft completed the 60-nautical mile (nm) trip back to Blue River visually. The aircraft slowly descended in steps as it flew south towards Blue River at a reduced cruise speed of approximately 175 knots. As the aircraft neared the aerodrome, the pilots descended to altitudes as low as 1100 feet above ground level (agl) to maintain visual contact with the ground in deteriorating weather. Approximately 4 nm from the aerodrome, and 85 seconds before touchdown, control was transferred from the first officer (FO) to the captain, who became the pilot flying (PF).During the approach, the crew rushed to complete the pre-landing checks, visually acquire the runway, and manoeuvre the aircraft to land. The captain turned slightly to the left, away from the runway centreline. At this point, the FO called visual contact with the runway, and the captain turned right, back towards the runway centreline, and again passed through the runway centreline. The captain did not acknowledge that the runway was in sight.The aircraft was configured for landing 25 seconds prior to touchdown. As viewed from the pilot's perspective, the aircraft was to the left of centreline. Several seconds later, the aircraft initiated a right turn to line up with the centreline of runway 19, but actually crossed to the right of the centreline. The aircraft then overflew several buildings on the right of the runway centreline, approximately 75 feet adjacent to the runway threshold. The aircraft then turned sharply to the left as it passed abeam the threshold, then sharply right to acquire the centreline before touching down approximately 2000 feet past the threshold. Immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered left into the snow bank.During the last 23 seconds of the flight, the FO broadcast a traffic advisory to indicate that the aircraft was on final, made 3 speed calls, and advised the captain that the runway was to the left. There were no remarks made by the captain since the request for the landing checklist. The FO did not declare an unstable approach, or prompt the captain to execute a missed approach."

While at 16,000 feet, approximately 100 miles from Yida, the no. 2 engine reportedly ceased. A restart was attempted and this was successful, but shortly after, the engine ceased again.The crew then opted to proceed to Yida on one engine while monitoring their descent rate. The rest of the flight was uneventful until touchdown at Yida. Shortly after commencing their landing roll, the crew heard a thud. The aircraft assumed a nose down attitude. Shortly thereafter, the nose gear collapsed. The aircraft was still rolling down the runway, with dust and other debris entering the cockpit from the damaged nose gear section.The aircraft eventually came to a stop, the pilot monitoring exited through the emergency exit.

88,ACC1901,"The crew of a firefighting Lockheed SP-2H Neptune (Air Tanker mod.) N355MA, ""Tanker 55"", reported it was unable to lower its left main landing gear and force landed at Minden-Tahoe Airport, in western Nevada. That crew had been helping with efforts to fight the George Fire within the Giant Sequoia National Monument in California. When on approach to Porterville, California, the main landing gear showed unsafe on port side. The pilot aborted the landing and climbed above pattern altitude where the landing gear was cycled again with same results. The left gear would not extend. A decision was made to return to the companys base at Minden-Tahoe Airport where contact was made with operations and maintenance personnel. After all emergency procedures and maintenance ideas were exhausted the pilot executed an emergency landing on runway 16 with main the left gear still in the up position. The nose and starboard gear were down and locked. After touchdown and bleeding off airspeed, the aircraft settled on the port jet pod and sustained left engine propeller strikes. As the aircraft came to a stop, the left jet pod pylon broke off, while being sideloaded from a side motion skid. There is no apparent damage to the wing structure or pylon attach points. Pilot and co-pilot exited the aircraft with no injuries."
89,ACC1902,"A Lockheed  P2V-7 Neptune (Air Tanker mod.) N14447, coded ""Tanker 11"", under contract to the US Forest Service, crashed about 20 miles north of Modena, Iron County, Utah, during a fire fighting operation against the White Rock Fire in the Hamblin Valley Area.Tanker 11 departed the tanker base to conduct its second fire retardant drop of the day in the same location. Upon arriving in the fire traffic area, Tanker 11 followed the lead airplane into the drop zone, which was located in a shallow valley 0.4 mile wide and 350 feet deep. The lead airplane flew a shallow right turn onto final and then dropped to an altitude of 150 feet above the valley floor while approaching the intended drop zone. While making the right turn onto final behind the lead airplane, Tanker 11's right wing tip collided with terrain, which resulted in a rapid right yaw and subsequent impact with terrain. The wreckage created a 1,088-foot-long debris field, and a post impact fire ensued. Two witnesses took photographs of the accident sequence photos, and an examination of these photographs showed that the lead airplane was positioned ahead of the tanker throughout the flight; however, the orientation of the lead airplane compared to the orientation of Tanker 11 indicated that Tanker 11 did not directly follow the lead airplane's path to the final drop course. Rather, it was about 700 feet left of the lead airplane's path and made a wider right turn as it attempted to align with the final drop course. The accident flight crewmembers had previously flown nearly the same exact drop and the lead pilot cautioned them about tailwind conditions during the flight; however, the wider turn suggests that they did not properly compensate for the wind conditions while maneuvering. In addition, the previous flight was conducted at an altitude above the ridgeline. GPS evidence indicates that the accident flight was conducted below the ridgeline, which would have made it more difficult to detect the rising terrain during the wider turn. A review of the airplane's cockpit voice recorder audio information revealed that the flight crew did not recognize or attempt to correct the reduced clearance between Tanker 11 and the rising terrain until about 2 seconds before impact."

93,ACC1906,"The aircraft, a Trans Maldivian Airways de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300, 8Q-TMT, experienced a left hand float collapse after striking the dock at Conrad Maldivian Resort, Rangali Island, while on taxi and became partially submerged. The aircraft sustained substantial damage and the 3 crew and 14 passengers escaped uninjured.During the 35-minute flight from Male to the Conrad Maldivian Resort, the weather was deteriorating with strong winds (approx 40-45 knots) from a westerly direction. The copilot, being pilot flying, landed the aircraft landed safely and the captain took over controls as a normal procedure and taxied through the channel for docking at the fixed platform attached to the main jetty.Since it was a fixed platform the crew had difficulty docking the aircraft in strong tailwind and swells. At the first attempt to dock the aircraft ended up forward of the platform which made the crew to abort docking. On the second attempt to dock, the captain applied full reverse and right rudder while the co-pilot applied opposite aileron to overcome the strong winds as the aircraft approached the fixed platform.However, the aircraft moved forward and hit the platform hard and the cabin crew, who was at his station on the left hand float, was flung into the water. On impact with the platform the left hand float attachments were sheared and the left hand propeller blades struck the platform surface while the right hand float lifted up and struck the right hand propeller. The captain reported cutting off the fuel at the first impact. The aircraft started turning, pivoting at its nose near the platform then started drifting away due to the strong winds and swells. Immediately after the impact water started seeping inside the aircraft. The captain attempted to secure the aircraft and the copilot was attempting to facilitate evacuation of the passengers.

(This fatality index is being listed as '1', because (as per ICAO Annex 13), for statistical uniformity, an injury resulting in death within thirty days of the date of the accident is classified as a fatal injury."
96,ACC1909,"A Beechcraft B200 Super King Air, OO-LET, was substantially damaged when its landing gear collapsed while landing at the Cambridge Airport (CBG), England. All four other crew members on board were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight which departed Cambridge Airfield.The airplane had been operating as a communications relay for the London Olympics and was returning to Cambridge. While descending to FL180 the pilots experienced a progressive failure of all of the electrical equipment, with the exception of the left instrument panel Electronic Flight Information System display. This remained powered by a backup power supply. However, as the display was giving erroneous information, the pilots decided to turn it off. The abnormal checklist did not contain a procedure for a total electrical failure, so the Pilot Flying turned off both generators and the battery switch before selecting them on again in an attempt to restore the electrical supply. He also selected the alternate inverter and the PNF recycled the cabin power supply switches. The PF stated that he did not attempt to select the generators to RESET. The left instrument panel had functioning ASI and vertical speed indicator (VSI) instruments; the right panel had a working attitude indicator (which was vacuum-driven), ASI and altimeter indications. The engine rpm gauges and standby compass remained operational. Mindful of avoiding a security alert during the Olympic Games, the crew carried out the pre-briefed communications failure procedure and turned the aircraft onto a northerly heading to clear the London TMA, before proceeding towards a designated holding area. As the aircraft approached the Wisbech area, the commander recognised some land features. The aircraft descended to 5,000 ft from where the crew were able to identify additional landmarks and navigate visually towards Cambridge Airport. By this time the aircraft had been flying for some time without electrical power and therefore without operating fuel gauges, and the crew were concerned about the aircraft's remaining endurance.When they arrived near the airport, they circled it to alert ATC to their presence and then carried out the Landing Gear Manual Extension procedure. When carrying out the procedure the pilots operated the landing gear control handle, but omitted to pull the landing gear relay circuit breaker. The PF operated the alternate extension handle to extend the landing gear. Initially, the handle was easy to operate and the pilots could see the main landing gear as it started to extend. The PF stated that he stopped operating the handle when heavy resistance was felt, in order not to damage the system. The PF also stated that the PNF had mentioned to him not to force the handle. The PF asked the PNF to check the resistance of the handle, which he did. The PF continued to operate the handle whilst they positioned the aircraft downwind and onto base leg, but stopped pumping each time he felt heavy resistance.The PF carried out a flapless approach and the aircraft touched down gently at approximately 100 kt. Almost immediately after touchdown, the landing gear started to collapse. The PNF immediately operated the fuel condition levers which shut down the engines and feathered the propellers. The aircraft settled onto the centreline luggage pod and the main undercarriage doors. It came to rest after a total ground run of approximately 400 m, during which it yawed slightly to the right. The PF was able to counteract the yaw with rudder sufficiently to prevent the aircraft from leaving the paved surface.After it had come to a halt, the commander ordered the technicians to evacuate. The pilots then completed the shutdown checklist before also vacating the aircraft. The flight time from the electrical failure until the landing was approximately 37 minutes."

100,ACC1913,"A DHC-8-315, registration N800AW, operated by the United States Department of State, experienced a hard landing on runway 29 at Kabul International Airport (KBL), Afghanistan. There were no injuries to the three passengers or three crewmembers onboard and the aircraft was substantially damaged. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time. The flight had originated from Tarin Kowt Airport (TII), AfghanistanAccording to the flight crew, the takeoff, climb and cruise were uneventful. The captain was the flying pilot. At 11:12 the flight was cleared for the approach and at 11:16 the flight crew selected flaps 35 and initiated a random steep approach in accordance with company task procedures as a result of the airport threat level. According to the flight crew statements, the airplane engine power was reduced to idle for the approach and was not increased prior to landing. Information obtained from Flight Data Recorder (FDR) indicated engine torque was at or near zero for the last 5 minutes of approach and landing.The aviation routine weather report at 05:50 local time indicated wind from 120 degrees at 5 knots, 8000 meters visibility and temperature 17 degrees C. For the two minutes prior to landing, the wind was light and variable. A tactical meteorological observation system on the field reported the wind direction during the two minutes prior to landing as variable from 004 degrees to 137 degrees and the wind speed variable from 1 knot to 7.2 knots. Wind gust recorded during the time period varied from 050 degrees to 079 degrees at 7.0 to 7.2 knots.Based on FDR data the calculated rate of descent was about 2,000 feet per minute during approach, reducing to about 1,500 feet per minute just prior to landing. The airplane touched down with a nose up pitch attitude of approximately 8 degrees and a peak vertical acceleration of 2.7g. The airplane geometry information provided by the manufacturer indicated that aft fuselage contact will result from a pitch attitude over 11.9 degrees with an extended landing gear oleo strut, and a pitch attitude over 6.8 degrees with a compressed landing gear oleo strut.In order to avoid nuisance warnings resulting from the random steep approach (i.e. steep angle descent), the flight crew deactivated the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) for approach. As these alerts would be expected by the crew during this type of approach, it is unlikely the alerts would have prompted the crew to take corrective action.The airplane touched down and contacted the aft fuselage on the runway resulting in substantial damage (including buckled, cracked, and bent frames and stringers)."

At 18:25 the pilot reported the airfield in sight.The aircraft descended until the empennage struck a tall dry tree about 14 km short of Yola Airport. The tail section separated and the aircraft hit the ground.  All occupants survived with various degrees of injuries. One of the victims was the Taraba State Governor, Danbaba Suntai.The investigation revealed that the throttle control position was found at below-idle beta position. It was further determined that the pilot had 58 hours in Cessna 172 aircraft with no type rating for the Cessna 208B and no night-time or instrument ratings."

105,ACC1918,"The Buffalo Airways Curtiss C-46A (C-GTXW) was operating as BFL509 on a local flight at Yellowknife, NT (CYZF). BFL509 landed on runway 10 and rolled to the intersection of runway 16/34 where the left main gear collapsed. The aircraft came to rest on the left wing resulting in substantial damage. There were no injuries to the 3 crew members. The aircraft had indicated three green and amber (normal) landing gear lights on approach. The cause of the collapse was found to be foreign object intrusion. It was found that a ball-peen hammer was lodged between the inboard drag strut and folding member. It is thought that the side load, which the hammer imposed, caused the down lock to slip out before full weight of the aircraft could insert the automatic gear pin. The aircraft was hoisted, the hammer removed and the gear locked in normally."
106,ACC1919,"A Cessna 550 Citation II corporate jet was destroyed in a runway collision with a deer at Greenwood Municipal Airport, SC (GRD), USA. Both occupants escaped uninjured. The deer was killed.According to the pilot, the purpose of the flight was to conduct a test of the autopilot and flight director systems on board the airplane following a ""cockpit modernization"" their company had performed. The airplane completed the NDB/GPS RWY 27 instrument approach procedure and then circled to land on Runway 9. About 5 seconds into the landing rollout, a deer appeared from the wood line and ran into the path of the airplane. The deer struck the airplane at the leading edge of the left wing above the left main landing gear, and ruptured an adjacent fuel cell. The pilot was able to maintain directional control, and the airplane was stopped on the runway, spilling fuel and on fire. The crew performed an emergency shutdown of the airplane and egressed without injury."
107,ACC1920,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, operated by Gogal Air Service, struck terrain shortly after takeoff from Snow Lake Airport, MB, Canada. The pilot died and the seven passengers were injured. Gogal Air Services was engaged by a local mining company to transport employees between Snow Lake and Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Caravan had accumulated some rime ice on the leading edges of the wings and the horizontal stabilizer from the flight into Snow Lake on the previous day. During the pre-flight inspection, the pilot tapped the leading edges of the wings with a broom handle in an attempt to remove the ice, but did not do this on the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft. Ice remained on the leading edges of the wings and tail before the flight. No de-icing or anti-icing fluids were applied to the wing or horizontal stabilizer, and no tactile inspection of the upper wing or tail surfaces was observed.The airplane departed at 09:55 and climbed to about 225 feet above ground level. It then pitched down. The aircraft's tail began to shudder and oscillate, the wings rocked, and a more pronounced second downward pitch ensued before the aircraft contacted the trees and crashed. There was no fire."

The An-26 touched down slightly left of the runway centreline and drifted further to the left. The left hand main landing gear ran into a 20-50 cm high snow bank at the edge of the runway. The airplane ran off the runway and came to rest on snowy terrain. The nose undercarriage collapsed and the right hand wing twisted forward, causing the no. 2 engine to touch the ground."
109,ACC1922,"The Douglas C-47TP turbine transport plane was destroyed when it crashed near Giant's Castle in the Drakensberg mountain range in South Africa. All 11 on board were killed.The aircraft belonged to the South African Air Force's 35 Squadron and operated on a routine flight from Waterkloof Air Force Base to Mthatha. The normal route was to fly towards Ladysmith, then on to Estcourt at FL110 and then descend to FL100 and turn towards Kokstad and Mthatha. The pilots apparently turned on a bearing of about 210 degrees and flew into the mountains near Giant's Castle, which is at some 13800 feet. Since no pre-flight briefing had taken place, it was not noticed that the flight plan contained too low an altitude for the surrounding terrain. Clouds and fog were present in the area, so the flight crew failed to observe the terrain elevation in relation to their altitude. Additionally, the aircraft was not equipped with a Ground Proximity Warning System.The on board weather radar included a mode showing weather as well as terrain, but was apparently not used.encountered severe weather conditions. Unconfirmed reports state that the aircraft last communicated with Air Traffic Control when above Giants Castle in the Drakensbergen mountain range, stating that they were at 11,000 feet and flying in Instrument Meteorological Conditions due to the bad visibility. The aircraft never arrived at Mthatha Airport.The wreckage was later found in Giants Castle in the Drakensberg in KwaZulu-Natal."
110,ACC1923,"A Cessna 501 airplane, N212M, was substantially damaged during recovery from an unusual attitude after departing from Detroit Lakes Airport (KDTL), Minnesota. The two pilots and four passengers were not injured. Night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the flight level of the accident, which had an intended destination of Bessemer Airport (KEKY), Alabama.After takeoff from runway 31, the pilot stated that the airplane entered IMC about 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL) and the autopilot was engaged about 3,000 feet mean sea level (MSL); 2,400 AGL. After receiving an air traffic control (ATC) clearance for a left turn on course, he rotated the heading select 'bug' to command the autopilot to initiate a left turn. While climbing through approximately 7,000 MSL, with the autopilot still engaged, the pilot stated that the airplane rolled to the left and transitioned rapidly into a nose down descent. Both pilots stated that their attention had been focused away from the attitude indicators during the time immediately prior to the unusual attitude commencing.The pilot disconnected the autopilot and attempted to recover the airplane, which he observed had entered into a nearly inverted, left turning spiral, with a steep nose down attitude. To recover from the unusual attitude, the pilot referenced the standby attitude indicator, turn needle, and heading indicator. Both wings were structurally damaged during recovery from the nose low attitude.Radar track data indicated on departure from KDTL, the airplane made a climbing left turn, leveled at 6,000 feet MSL, and subsequently flew straight ahead at 6,000 feet MSL for about 30 seconds. Next, the airplane made a climbing, right turn to about 7,200 feet MSL and then transitioned into a descending spiral to the right, with a descent rate exceeding 10,000 feet per minute. The descending spiral continued until about 3,500 feet MSL. The airplane then transitioned to a right climbing turn through 4,800 feet MSL and subsequently began to climb with a wings level attitude."
111,ACC1924,"The aircraft, operated by the Nayarit State Government, Mexico, was deployed to La Yesca in order to pick up two soldiers who had been injured in a traffic accident and take them to Zapopan, State of Jalisco (MMZP). During takeoff, the Islander encountered strong cross winds that caused it to drift sideways, hitting a tree with one of the wings. The pilot lost control and crashed into the bushes. Although the plane was a total loss, the pilot was only slightly injured, and the two soldiers also escaped alive. The three of them were picked up by helicopters and taken to hospitals in the States of Jalisco and Nayarit, in stable condition."
112,ACC1925,"A Beechcraft B100 King Air turboprop plane was destroyed when it struck terrain on top of Swede Mountain, north northeast of Libby Airport, MT, USA. The pilot and passenger were killed. The flight left Coolidge Municipal Airport, AZ about 20:25 on December 18, piloted by the CEO of Stinger Welding Inc. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that the pilot had been cleared for the GPS-A instrument approach procedure for the Libby Airport. The clearance had a crossing restriction of 10,700 feet at the PACCE intersection, which was the initial approach fix for the GPS-A approach. The pilot acknowledged that clearance at 23:53. At 23:59, the airplane target was about 7 miles south of the airport; the pilot reported the field in sight, and cancelled the IFR flight plan.A police officer reported that he observed an airplane fly over the city of Libby, which was north of the airport; the airplane then turned toward the airport. The officer went to the airport to investigate, but observed no airplane. He noted that it was foggy in town, but the airport was clear. He also observed that the rotating beacon was illuminated, but not the pilot controlled runway lighting.The flight was reported overdue during the day; the wreckage was located at 18:35 on a tree covered slope.	The town and airport were located within a sparsely populated area that had limited lighting conditions, which, along with the clouds and 35 percent moon illumination, would have restricted the pilots visual references. These conditions likely led to his being geographically disoriented (lost) and his subsequent failure to maintain sufficient altitude to clear terrain. Although the pilot did not possess a valid pilots certificate, a review of his logbooks indicated that he had considerable experience flying the airplane, usually while accompanied by another pilot, and that he had flown in both visual and IFR conditions. A previous student pilot medical certificate indicated that the pilot was color blind and listed limitations for flying at night and for using color signals. The pilot had applied for another student pilot certificate 2 months before the accident, but this certificate was deferred pending a medical review."
113,ACC1926,"A Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III passenger plane was involved in an accident at Sanikiluaq Airport, NU (YSK), Canada. The flight crew sustained serious injuries, 6 passengers sustained minor injuries and one passenger, an infant, was fatally injured. The route from Winnipeg to Sanikiluaq is normally operated by Keewatin Air, a Perimeter Aviation sister company. The normally scheduled flight on the previous day (Friday, 21 December 2012) had been cancelled due to poor weather in Sanikiluaq. With extra cargo and passengers needing to travel to Sanikiluaq before Christmas, Keewatin Air completed a flight on the morning of 22 December 2012 and had chartered Perimeter to complete an additional flight. The Perimeter flight crew had been notified in the early evening of 21 December 2012 that they would be operating flight PAG993 the next morning.Following an attempted visual approach to runway 09, a non-precision non-directional beacon (NDB) runway 27 approach was conducted. Visual contact with the runway environment was made and a circling for runway 09 initiated. Visual contact with the runway 09 environment was lost and a return to the Sanikiluaq NDB was executed. A second NDB runway 27 approach was conducted with the intent to land on runway 27. Visual contact with the runway environment was made after passing the missed approach point. Following a steep descent, a rejected landing was initiated at 20 to 50 feet above the runway; the aircraft struck the ground approximately 525 feet beyond the departure end of runway 27."

All 20 passengers and seven crew members were killed.The airplane was operated by the Kazakhstan Border Guards. Among those killed was acting director of National Security Committee's Border Guard Service, Colonel Turganbek Stambekov. The airplane took off from Astana Airport (TSE) at 16:52 with destination Shymkent Airport (CIT). Shortly after takeoff the autopilot failed. The captain then decided to fly the plane manually. Two minutes and 40 seconds after takeoff the radio altimeter also failed. The flight was continued using barometric altimeters. Nineteen minutes into the flight there was a momentary failure of these altimeters as well, with the altitude dropping from 696 to -1375 metres. Three minutes later the altimeter again suffered a momentary spike, this time from 749 m to 2672 m.En route and during the descent towards Shymkent the flight encountered poor weather with heavy snowfall and limited visibility. During the approach to Shymkent, the captain failed to set the correct pressure for the barometric altimeters. The altitude indicated was therefore off by about 385 metres. The airplane struck the slope of a ravine 21 km short of the runway and broke up."
115,ACC1928,"An Air Bagan Fokker 100 aircraft registered XY-AGC departed Yangon International Airport, Myanmar on a domestic scheduled passenger flight to Mandalay International Airport with the captain as pilot flying. The aircraft was refueled at Mandalay after 60 passengers disembarked and 46 passengers boarded. The captain made the briefing and completed the aircraft checks. At 08:26 local time, the flight departed Mandalay to Heho Airport. The first officer was designated as the Pilot Flying for the flight. The aircraft climbed to FL130 and the captain contacted Heho ATC at 50 NM from Heho. Heho ATC provided the present weather condition (wind calm, visibility 3000 m, distinct fog, temperature 17°C, QNH 1018 mb, runway 36 in use). At about 08:36 local time, the first officer started the crew briefing. The aircraft started descend to 9000 ft and continued to overhead the Heho NDB. At about 08:47 local time, while heading 220 degrees and descending to 6000 ft the flight commenced a non-precision Non Directional Beacon (NDB) approach to runway 36.During the final inbound track at about 2.5 NM to the runway at 08:52, the EGPWS aural warning called out ""500"". The captain initiated ""Alt hold"" at about 08:53, just before the EGPWS alert ""100"" ""50"" 40"" ""30"" and the aircraft struck 66 KV power lines, trees, telephone cables, a fence and collided with terrain short of the runway, coming to rest approximately 0.7 NM from the threshold. During the ground collision, both wings separated and a fire commenced almost immediately. An emergency evacuation was initiated by the cabin crews. One aircraft occupant and one motorcyclist on the ground were fatally injured, 70 of the occupants and one motorcyclist survived and the aircraft was destroyed by fire."
116,ACC1929,"A Canadair CRJ-200 operated by SCAT was destroyed in an accident near Almaty Airport (ALA), Kazakhstan, killing all 16 passengers and five crew members. Flight DV760 operated on a domestic flight from Kokshetau Airport (KOV) to Almaty (ALA).Weather forecast obtained by the crew before departure showed a visibility of 800 m at Almaty with a vertical visibility of 90 m, and temporary reduced visibility to 200 meters. The flight took off at 11:19 hours local time. The captain was Pilot Flying.At 12:00 the flight contacted Almaty Control and received the current weather conditions which showed a limited visibility for runway 23R of 200 m. At 12:40 the flight was cleared to descend to FL80. By then visibility had decreased to 175 m. The captain decided to continue descent and prepare for an approach to decision height. The captain became increasingly stressed by the poor weather conditions. After reaching FL80 the crew were told to remain at that altitude because of another flight in the area.This provoked a strong emotional reaction from the captain.At 12:57 the flight was then cleared down to 1600 m. During the descent the lack of improvement of weather conditions caused a greater and greater irritation on the part of the captain. When turning to finals the runway visual range (RVR) for the first, mid and last part of runway 23R was reported as 275-250-225 m in freezing fog with a vertical visibility of 40 meters. With continuing visibility updates the flight crew kept descending until it was clear that a landing was impossible given the lack of visual contact with the ground.A missed approach was initiated at 13:10 from a height of 180 m. The autopilot was disconnected and the TO/GA button was pushed. Engine power increased and the flaps were raised to 8°. In the four seconds after pressing to TO/GA button there were no control inputs. Then the captain pushed the control column forward, causing the aircraft to descend. The EGPWS warning sounded as the pitch changed to -9. The observer pilot tried to draw attention on the EGPWS warning but there was no response on the controls by the flight crew. Pitch angle further increased to -16° and vertical speed was -20 to -30 m/sec. The aircraft impacted the ground at high speed and a -20° pitch angle and broke up."

120,ACC1933,"A Beechcraft 1900 cargo plane was destroyed when it impacted rising terrain some 32 km northeast of Dillingham Municipal Airport, AK (DLG). Both crew members were killed. The flight had originally departed Anchorage, AK (ANC) about 05:44, and made a scheduled stop at King Salmon, AK (AKN), before continuing on to the next scheduled stop, Dillingham, AK (DLG). As the airplane approached Dillingham, the flight crew requested the RNAV GPS 19 instrument approach to the Dillingham Airport about 07:57 from controllers at the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The ARTCC specialist on duty subsequently granted the request by issuing the clearance, with instructions to proceed direct to the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) to begin the approach, and to maintain an altitude of 2,000 feet or above. A short time later the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern at the IAF so that they could contact the Flight Service Station (FSS) for a runway conditions report, and the ARTCC specialist granted that request. The ARTCC specialist then made several attempts to contact the aircraft, but was unsuccessful and subsequently lost radar track on the aircraft. An ELT signal indicated it had come down in the Muklung Hills. The wreckage was located the next day at an altitude of 2000 feet on the south side of the Muklung Hills."
121,ACC1934,"On 27 March 2013, an Air Labrador Twin Otter was landing at St. Anthony Airport, with 2 crew members and 8 passengers on board. On approach to runway 10, the captain and first officer discussed approach and landing considerations due to the strong crosswinds, and it was decided that the first officer would continue the approach. Immediately prior to landing, the first officer experienced difficulty, so control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain. The transfer of control was completed less than 2 seconds prior to landing. The aircraft touched down on the left main wheel, bounced, and landed hard on the nosewheel; the nose landing gear collapsed due to overstress failures. Directional control was lost, and the aircraft skidded on its nose and came to rest 96 feet off the north side of the runway. There were no injuries, and the aircraft was substantially damaged.The investigation determined that, when control of the aircraft was passed to the captain, there was insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing due to the substantial crosswind. The Air Labrador Twin Otter standard operating procedures (SOPs) do not state when the captain should permit the first officer to act as pilot flying or relieve the first officer from that role. When allowing the first officer to fly in challenging conditions, the captain must be prepared to take control of the aircraft in adequate time to ensure the safety of the flight. Also, there is an increased risk of a landing accident if a required briefing is not conducted. Crew members may not share a common plan for the approach and landing, and, as in this case, transfer of control may not be conducted in a timely manner."
122,ACC1935,"A Beechcraft MC-12W Liberty reconnaissance plane crashed northeast of Kandahar Airport (KDH) in Afghanistan, killing all four crew members.The airplane was based at Kandahar and operated by the US Air Force on a combat intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission.The airplane, callsign Independence 08, departed Kandahar at 11:57 and entered orbit at 12:29. Upon entering the operating area about 12:29, they encountered a cloud deck partially covering their orbit area and a large, rapidly building towering cumulous cloud in the center of their orbit area from 17,000 ft to 24,000 ft mean sea level (MSL).The towering cumulus clouds began to grow and drift into the airplane's orbit, prompting a request to climb from 20,000 ft to 23,000 ft. This translates to climbing from 13,800 to 16,800 ft above ground level.The airplane was in a left hand orbit, preparing to shift the orbit, when the pilot initiated the climb with the autopilot on at 12:40:40.While or just after initiating the climb, the pilot continued working an orbit adjustment to better service tracking an active target, and approximately ten seconds after the climb was initiated, the climb rate increased. Fifteen seconds afterward the pilot noticed he had allowed the airspeed to decrease during the climb, stating, ""A little slow, correcting."" Seven seconds later, the mission commander in the right hand seat said, ""Alright, firewall,"" meaning to advance the throttles as far forward as they would go, and one second later, the auto-pilot was disengaged.The propellers on the MC-12W do not counter-rotate, and advancing the power in the MC-12W produces left-handed torque and P-factor, creating a left yaw and making the aircraft to want to turn left; the airplane was already in a left-hand turn and left bank. Two seconds after calling to ""firewall"" the throttles, and one second after auto-pilot disengagement, the bank angle warning tone sounded, indicating the left bank had rapidly increased to greater than 50 degrees. The mission commander again called for full power, and four seconds later, he directed ""eyes inside,"" telling the pilot to refer to his instruments for attitude and airspeed information; contemporaneously, the stall warning sounded. The stall warning horn stopped after five seconds, and a second later, background noise indicates items began flying around within the cockpit and the bank angle warning stopped. The pilot stated: ""Whoa, pull up"".The mission commander then advised the pilot to look at his airspeed and took over the aircraft, calling for a reduction in power. Four seconds after the mission commander took the aircraft, the aircraft overspeed warning sounded, followed by the landing gear horn sounding. The landing gear horn indicates the throttles were reduced toward idle, and it did not sound until 15 seconds after initial stall warning sounded. The MA reached a maximum recorded height of 20,900 ft. and lost approximately 15,000 ft before impacting the ground.The airplane impacted with the fuselage slightly nose-low, in a left bank, with minimal forward momentum. The airplane was destroyed upon impact and burned during the post-crash fire ."

124,ACC1937,"A DHC-6 Twin Otter passenger plane sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at Jomsom Airport (JMO), Nepal. Two crew members and one passenger sustained serious injuries.The airplane departed Pokhara Airport (PKR) at 08:10 on a domestic flight to Jomsom. While descending towards the destination airport, the Jomsom controller reported that there was a south-westerly 8-12 knot wind with runway 24 in use.During the approach the pilot in command took over the communication function of the copilot and contacted Jomsom Tower, requesting to use runway 06 instead of runway 24, despite the advice of the tower controller to use runway 24 to avoid tail wind effect in runway 06. The tailwind component, exceeded the five knot tailwind limit stipulated in the companys standard operating procedure.The airplane touched down 776 feet past the threshold of the 2,424-foot-long runway 06. It covered a distance of 194 feet on the airstrip and veered towards the grassland. During the landing roll, when the aircraft was decelerating, the co-pilot had raised the flaps as per the existing practice of carrying out the after the landing checks.""The pilot in command added power to re-enter the runway. After running 705 feet on the grassland the airplane entered the runway again. Without making his intentions clear to the copilot, the pilot in command continued adding power for go around. The accelerating aircraft gained insufficient speed and lift to take off and ran out of the runway 24 end, continued towards the river, hit the barbed fence and gabion wall with an initial impact and finally fell down onto the banks of Kaligandaki River."

When the engine power levers were moved to a low power setting prior to touchdown there was no landing gear up warning horn heard.
135,ACC1948,"SkyBahamas Airlines flight Q7-9561, a Saab 340B, sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at Marsh Harbour International Airport (MHH), Bahamas.The flight crew received weather information and IFR route clearance from the controller at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, Florida, USA. Departure time was 13:06 hours local time. From the cockpit voice recorder it was evident that the flight crew failed to brief or discuss the weather for departure or enroute. Additionally, they failed to complete several important checklists as required and did not observe sterile cockpit procedures during startup, run-up, taxi and takeoff. The enroute and approach checklists were not conducted prior to arriving near their destination of Marsh Harbour Airport, Bahamas. The crew was aware of the weather conditions at Marsh Harbor, which included heavy rainshowers; however, they never formulated a plan for diversion if the weather was bad at their time of arrival.As the approach continued there were constant disagreements between both pilots as to who had the runway in sight. Due to the weather conditions, visibility of the runway was intermittent, yet the crew continued descending visually in an attempt to land the aircraft on a runway that was not in sight and not served by an instrument landing system (ILS).The crew flew a non-stabilized approach and speed was not constant as they kept increasing and decreasing speed throughout the final approach. The captain, who initially was the non-flying pilot, while on final approach and below 500 feet AGL, assumed control of the aircraft from the flying pilot (first officer). At some point the captain lost use of his windshield wiper as it went over-center and was stuck. During the final moments of the approach. The copilot again assumed control of the aircraft and seconds before touch down, the captain (despite having no visual contact with the runway due to the intense downpour of rain and the non-use of his windshield wiper), again took control of the aircraft from the first officer.By the time the aircraft touched the runway, there were several control wheel exchanges between both pilots while neither had a visual of the runway.The aircraft initially touched down at 17:49:02 with a recorded vertical load factor of +2.16G, approximately 14 seconds after crossing the threshold of runway 09. Upon initial landing however, the aircraft bounced and became airborne, reaching a calculated maximum height of approximately 15 feet AGL.The aircraft bounced a second time at 17:49:07 with a recorded vertical load factor of +3.19G. During this second bounce, the pitch attitude was 1.8 degrees nose down, heading 102 degrees magnetic and airspeed 106 KIAS.The aircraft made consecutive contact with the runway approximately three times. The third and final bounce occurred at 17:49:14 with a recorded vertical load factor of +3.66G. During the third bounce, the pitch attitude was 2.2 degrees nose down, heading 099 degrees magnetic and airspeed 98 KIAS.As a result of the hard touchdown, damage was sustained to the right wing and right hand engine/propeller. The right hand engine parameters recorded a rapid loss of power with decreasing engine speed and torque, and subsequent propeller stoppage. The aircraft veered off to the right at approximate time of 17:49:20 on a heading of 131 degrees magnetic at a point approximately 6,044 feet from the threshold of runway 09.The recorded airspeed was 44 KIAS with the left hand engine torque at 26 % and the right hand engine torque at 0%. The aircraft came to a full stop at approximate time 17:49:25 on a heading of 231 degrees magnetic. When the aircraft came to a stop, the flight and cabin crew and 21 passengers evacuated the aircraft. The evacuation was uneventful using the main entrance door."
136,ACC1949,"An Israel Aircraft Industries 1124 airplane, N112EM, was substantially damaged during landing at Cincinnati Municipal Airport, OH (KLUK). The flight instructor, pilot, and passenger did not report any injuries. The local instructional flight departed Cincinnati Municipal Airport about 10:45.After landing on runway 21L, the flight instructor directed the pilot to advance the throttles for a touch-and-go. During the maneuver, the left main gear collapsed and the airplane came to a stop near the end of the runway, resting on its left wing."
137,ACC1950,"The An-2 was operating on mosquito-killing tasks out of Fertöszentmiklós Airfield, Hungary.For the planned 3 hours of flight, the tanks were filled with a total of 1046 liters of chemicals and 1200 liters of fuel. The take-off mass of the aircraft then exceeded the maximum take-off mass by at least 150 kg.At 17:45 local time, the aircraft rolled onto a grassy area parallel to runway 16 and began taking off with a 15° flap position.The pilot said that he felt that the engine's performance was slightly below normal, but considered it justified by the high outside temperature (33-34°C). After becoming airborne the pilot noticed increasing engine vibrations. He turned to the left to avoid the high-voltage power line ahead. Altitude at that time was 3 meters. In order to increase lift, he raised the flaps to 20° and then to 25°, but he continued to lose height during the turn. The left wing tip hit a corn field, followed by the undercarriage. The aircraft nosed down and came to rest. The collision caused the engine to run out of lubricating oil, which caused a fire. The fire was extinguished by the pilot using a hand fire extinguisher.There was no personal injury and the aircraft was severely damaged."
138,ACC1951,"An Embraer EMB-110P1 Bandeirante aircraft crashed while on approach to Francistown Airport (FRW), Botswana, killing both crew members.The airplane was en route from Lanseria to Lubumbashi (FBM), D.R. Congo when it attempted to land at Francistown, a regular refuelling stop.Aviation sources report that the aircraft did an instrument approach due to shallow fog. The crew performed a go-around, then told the tower they could see the runway and were going to approach from the opposite direction. The airplane crashed in a bushy area."
139,ACC1952,"On the day before the accident, the flight crew had completed 53 water-drop flights at a forest fire located northeast of Wabush, Newfoundland and Labrador. Each flight, typically about 3 minutes long, consisted of scooping water from Moosehead Lake, dropping the water on the fire, and then returning for another water scoop. All flights were made with the PROBES AUTO/MANUAL switch in the AUTO selection. The switch was left in this position at the end of these flights.At about 14:00 on the day of the accident, the flight crew were deployed to the same forest fire that they had been working on the day before. The captain was the pilot flying (PF) for the occurrence flight and occupied the left seat. The captain removed the centre pedestal cover during the pre-flight preparations. The first officer, who was the pilot not flying (PNF), completed the exterior walk-around and carried out the pre-flight cockpit checks.The aircraft had 7000 pounds of fuel and 1000 pounds of chemical foam on board. Utilizing this information, the water-drop control computer determined the maximum quantity of water to be scooped. The flight crew considered the wind speed and direction and decided to follow the same practice as the previous day and scoop water from Moosehead Lake.After takeoff, the PNF was required to complete the ""After Takeoff"" checklist, and in preparation for scooping water, to complete the ""Water Bombing in Range"" and ""Pick-up"" checklists.About 4 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft touched down about 1250 feet from the eastern shore of the lake, on a heading of 250°. The PF then applied takeoff power, and the PNF began adjusting the torque limit stops. Throughout the scooping run, the PNF was focused on ensuring that the soft stops were set as per the PF's instructions.While adjusting the soft stops, the PNF noted that the water tanks were completely full, and advised the PF that the probes were still down and the PROBE AUTO/MANUAL switch was in the MANUAL selection. The PNF then manually selected the probes up. The probes retracted about 3490 feet after touchdown.The flight crew continued the takeoff despite indication by the water status display panel that water quantity was in excess of that allowable for this takeoff.At the time the probes were retracted, the aircraft was about 2500 feet from the departure-end shoreline of the lake. The PF determined that the aircraft would require a greater distance to become airborne and initiated a left turn to follow the lake. About 2 seconds later, the aircrafts hull began to lift out of the water, and the left float contacted the water.For the next 4 seconds, aileron and rudder control surface deflections commanded a left turn; however, during this time, the aircraft was skidding to the outside of the turn. The float remained in contact with the water, and the aircrafts hull was completely out of the water. The PF deflected the elevators up to near full deflection, with no corresponding response in pitch attitude, and then initiated a right turn using ailerons, with no response to this input.About a second later, the aircrafts hull was about 7 feet above the water, with the float still in contact with the water. The float separated from its pylon, resulting in a sudden pitch-down moment.The forward section of the hull collided with the water, causing the lower part of the forward fuselage to tear open. The right wing float collided with the water, causing complete separation of the right float and pylon. The aircraft came to rest upright, with the cockpit partially underwater. The flight crew briefly delayed their evacuation until the propellers had stopped rotating.The PNF retrieved a life vest and evacuated the aircraft through the overhead escape hatch. Once on top of the aircraft, the PNF donned the life vest. The PF could not retrieve a life vest and exited the aircraft through the left-side sliding window.The flight crew remained on the wing as the aircraft continued to sink. The PNF contacted company personnel by cellular telephone and advised them of the situation. Within about 30 minutes, Department of Natural Resources employees arrived by boat and transported the flight crew to shore.The aircraft settled on the lake bottom, about 225 feet from the southern shore of the lake.Neither pilot attempted to remotely activate the emergency locator transmitter (ELT), shut down the engines or select electrical power OFF."
140,ACC1953,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-3T Texas Turbine Otter crashed during takeoff from runway 25 at Soldotna Airport, AK (SXQ), killing all ten on board. The plane crashed with its right wing down and nose low and came to rest 2,320 feet from the threshold of the runway, in a grassy area 154 feet to the right of the runway centreline. A fire destroyed much of the aircraft.A video taken by one of the passengers during takeoff was analysed by investigators. Speed started declining as soon as the airplane took off and the angle of attack increased. The airplane stalled at an altitude of 120 feet at a speed of about 44 mph.Baggage that was recovered after the accident weighed 613 lbs (278 kg) in total. The load manifest listed a total cargo weight of 300 lbs (136 kg), based on an estimate made by the operator of the lodge where the passengers were headed."
141,ACC1954,"A Sukhoi Superjet 100-95 was involved in a flight test accident during a go-around at Keflavík International Airport (KEF), Iceland. The five persons on board suffered minor injuries.At 04:03 hours local time the Sukhoi Superjet took off from runway 20 at Keflavík Airport for flight testing with a crew of five on board. The airplane had been undergoing certification flight tests for almost one month at Keflavík Airport. This was the crew's fourth test flight since their work shift started at 18:00 the day before. The pilot flying was sitting in the right cockpit pilot seat.Seven approaches and go-arounds were performed with possible landing gear touchdown to runway 20, followed by two to runway 11. During the final approach to runway 11 at 05:22, the landing gear was selected down. The approach was normal. At 05:23 the flight crew initiated the 9th test of the flight. The purpose of the test was to simulate a CAT IIIA automatic approach, close to the airplane's maximum landing weight limit, while in crosswind exceeding 10 m/s (19.5 knots), with a critical engine failure occurring at radio altitude of 25 feet, resulting in a low pass/missed approach. When the aircraft was at radio altitude of about 10 ft the flight certification expert sitting in the jump seat in the cockpit shut down the right engine using the ENG MASTER SWITCH. After the right engine was shut off, the right autothrottle disconnected and the right throttle lever stopped moving to idle, while the left autothrottle continued moving the left throttle lever back to idle.At a radio altitude of about 4 feet the pilot flying disengaged the autopilot. This caused disengagement of all autopilot/flight director control modes and the left autothrottle reverted to SPEED mode. When the left autothrottle reverted to SPEED mode, the left throttle lever had already reached IDLE. At that time the airplane speed had reduced down below the ""limit selectable speed"", so the left autothrottle started moving the left throttle lever forward.The pilot flying pressed the TOGA (Take Off/Go Around) button on the right throttle lever to initiate a goaround. Almost simultaneously the main landing gear touched the runway.The left engine autothrottle and flight director then disengaged automatically. The pilot flying then noticed at the primary flight display that the go-around mode had not engaged when he selected the TOGA switch. The pilot flying also noticed that the flight director was not available and that the autothrottle was switched off. The pilot flying then started to perform a go around in manual mode, setting the right (inoperative) engine throttle lever to TO/GA, pitched-up the aircraft and ordered landing gear retraction.During the go-around procedure, after the landing gear was retracted, the airplane started to loose speed. The airplane stopped climbing having reached a maximum radio altitude of 27 feet at and then started to descend. The speed decreased further, below 120 knots. The pilot flying then set the right throttle lever to MAX. The speed continued to decrease and the pilot flying, now aware of both the speed loss and the loss of altitude, reduced the nose pitch to try to counteract stalling.The airplane's aural warning ""LANDING GEAR NOT DOWN"" triggered at that time.The pilot flying realized that engine was not in takeoff mode and checked engine power settings. He found out that operating left engine was in N1=50% mode and realized that he had been controlling the inoperative engine.The pilot flying set the left engine throttle lever to MAX. The airplane was still descending and while the left engine was spooling up, the airplane hit the runway.As the landing gear was in the up position, it was the fuselage aft lower belly that hit the runway first. This was on the left side of the runway center line, as due to the loss of airspeed and the crosswind the airplane had drifted to the left.This was followed by the engines' cowlings touching the runway. As the airplane nose had been turned into the wind when it hit the runway, it initially veered to the right, as it skidded down the runway, across the runway centerline. The pilot flying counteracted this movement with a left rudder input and steered the airplane back towards the runway centerline.The pilot flying set both throttle lever's to IDLE position at and then to deploy the thrust reversers. The airplane skidded off the end of runway 11 and came to rest after having passed 163 meters beyond the threshold of runway 29.After the airplane had come to a stop, the pilot in command, who was also the pilot flying, ordered an emergency evacuation. The forward left door was opened by the cockpit crew, but the emergency escape slide did not deploy. The crew member operating the test equipment in the cabin opened the rear left door and its slide deployed. The cockpit crew then opened the forward rightdoor. The slide deployed, but due to the crosswind it blew underneath the belly of the airplane and was unusable. The whole crew evacuated the airplane via the rear left door."
142,ACC1955,"An Antonov 2 biplane sustained substantial damage in a hard landing accident near Shakhty Airport, Russia. The pilot was not injured.According to preliminary data, the airplane had been bought some seven months before the accident by an individual who worked as a mechanic at the a local aircraft repair plant at Shakhty Airport. He did not possess a valid pilot's licence.Shortly after takeoff, the engine lost power. The pilot made a hard landing in a field and fled the scene. He was later questioned by police."

144,ACC1957,"A Beechcraft B200 Super King Air was destroyed in an accident near Akureyri Airport (AEY), Iceland. A medic and the captain were killed. The other pilot received minor injuries.The air ambulance plane had transported a patient from Höfn to Reykjavik, Iceland and was returning to the home base at Akureyri Airport. The repositioning flight departed Reykjavik at 12:44 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL170.During cruise, the flight crew discussed the captain's wish to deviate from the planned route to, in order to fly over a racetrack area near the airport. At the racetrack, a race was about to start at that time. The commander had planned to visit the racetrack area after landing.The aircraft approached Akureyri from the south and at 10.5 DME the flight crew cancelled IFR. When passing KN locator (KRISTNES), the flight crew made a request to Akureyri Tower to overfly the town of Akureyri, before landing. The request was approved by the tower and the flight crew was informed that a Fokker 50 was ready for departure on runway 01. The flight crew of TF-MYX responded and informed that they would keep west of the airfield. After passing KN, the altitude was approximately 800 ft MSL. The co-pilot mentioned to the commander that they were a bit low and recommended a higher altitude. The altitude was then momentarily increased to 1000 ft.When approaching the racetrack area, the aircraft entered a steep left turn. During the turn, the altitude dropped until the aircraft hit the racetrack. The left wing touched the ground and the airplane broke up while impacting terrain at Hlíðarfjall Road, northwest of Akureyri Airport. A post-impact fire erupted."
145,ACC1958,"An Antonov 12 cargo plane, operated by Ukraine Air Alliance, was destroyed by fire during startup at Leipzig Airport (LEJ), Germany. All crew members escaped.The aircraft, UR-CAG, arrived as flight UKL751 at Leipzig at 19:14 on August 8, after a flight from Stockholm, Sweden. The airplane parked at Stand 207. Loading operations commenced at 23:30 and were finished at 01:00. The cargo consisted of almost 49,000 day old chickens, weighing 3061 kg. The airplane was then fueled with 22,908 litres of fuel for the flight to Mineralnye Vody Airport (MRV), Russia. Fueling was completed at 01:21. Planned departure time was 02:15. At 02:01 the controller at Leipzig cleared the crew to start the engines. The APU was started, followed by the no. 1 engine. During the starting process of engine no. 4, the crew heard a muffled bang and the airplane jerked. The co-pilot, who was monitoring the instruments during the starting process, had observed variations in APU speed and an increase in temperature. Immediately the APU fire warning flashed. The crew shut down both engines and activated the fire-extinguishing system of the APU.A flight mechanic then opened the emergency hatch located below the flight deck and observed the fire in the area of the APU. Other crew members handed him three fire extinguishers that were located on the flight deck. The flight engineer and two flight mechanics then proceeded to the fire and emptied the extinguishers. The captain meanwhile instructed the radio operator to warn the tower controller about the fire. The controller was contacted at 02:07. He activated the fire alarm at 02:08:00 and reported the location of the fire at 02:09. The first crash tender reached the airplane at 02:12 and began an attempt to put out the fire.By then all crew members had evacuated through the emergency exit below the flight deck. The airplane burned out.Due to the high degree of destruction it was not possible to determine the exact cause of the fire. It is possible that the compressor wheel had burst."

148,ACC1961,"A Buffalo Airways Douglas DC-3C sustained damage after colliding with terrain near Yellowknife Airport, Canada.Prior to departure, Flight BFL168 was loaded with cargo and 17 passengers at the Buffalo Airways hangar. Passengers were processed through the Buffalo Airways terminal, where they checked in and dropped off their checked luggage. Passengers and their baggage were not weighed at the check-in counter. After the aircraft had been loaded, 4 last-minute passengers were boarded along with their luggage.At the time of departure, the operational flight plan (OFP) was partially completed and did not reflect the number of passengers on board or the weight of the cargo. The crew did not receive a cargo manifest prior to departure.At 17:08, BFL168 received take-off clearance from the Yellowknife tower controller and initiated the take-off run from runway 16 at the intersection of runways 16/34 and 10/28. The runway distance available from the intersection was approximately 5956 feet.At 17:10, the tower controller observed heavy torching and smoke from the right engine and called to advise BFL168 of this observation. The tower controller received no response from BFL168. The crew of BFL168 was in the process of retracting the landing gear when a fire was observed in the right engine. An emergency engine shut down was performed, which included feathering the right propeller. As the right propeller was moving towards a feathered condition, it stopped feathering before reaching the full feathered position and returned to windmilling. BFL168 made a low-altitude right turn in an attempt to reach runway 10. The maximum height achieved by BFL168 was approximately 180 feet above ground level (agl).While manoeuvring, BFL168 struck a stand of trees, about 30 feet in height, 690 feet southwest from the threshold of runway 10. The initial point of ground contact was 400 feet beyond the trees. BFL168's wreckage trail was parallel to and south of runway 10 and was about 330 feet in length. The landing gear and the flaps were in the retracted position. Due to the relatively low-energy impact, the emergency locator transmitter (ELT) did not activate.Once the aircraft came to a complete stop, the flight attendant initiated the evacuation of the 21 passengers through the left-aft door. The flight attendant returned to the aircraft and moved some galley drawers that were blocking the cockpit, and confirmed that the flight crew was safe. The 3 crew members subsequently evacuated the aircraft. ARFF sprayed the aircraft with fire retardant foam as a precaution. The crew and passengers, none of whom were injured, remained at the site under the supervision of ARFF for approximately 60 minutes. They were subsequently transported back to the Buffalo Airways terminal building."

150,ACC1963,"A Beechcraft 1900D passenger plane operating as flight GLA7125 from Denver International Airport, CO (DEN) to Telluride Airport, CO (TEX) was damaged in a landing accident on runway 27.During approach to landing the crew selected landing gear down and observed a problem with the left main landing gear (MLG). The landing gear hydraulic motor pump automatically shut down when the landing gear was not locked down after 16 seconds and an internal mechanical lock intended to hold the landing gear actuator in the selected position, did not engage.The crew carried out the abnormal procedures checklist and attempted to extend the left MLG using the manual landing gear extension procedures, but was unsuccessful. The crew then prepared for landing in accordance with the procedures contained in the quick reference handbook for landing with main gear up or unsafe.As the airplane slowed through about 80 knots on the landing roll, the left main landing gear collapsed.Post-accident inspection indicated hydraulic fluid had leaked from a hole, which was normally plugged with a Lee plug, on the left main actuator between the primary and secondary extend ports. The Lee plug was missing and was not found. Examination of the actuator and of the hydraulic fluid quantity remaining indicated the Lee plug was in place during the in-flight attempts to extend the landing gear.The airplane landed with the gear not locked down and as the landing gear collapsed, the piston in the actuator forced hydraulic fluid back through the system increasing the landing gear actuator internal hydraulic pressure sufficiently to force the Lee plug out of position. The remaining fluid in the actuator leaked out of the hole until system pressure decreased to ambient pressure."
151,ACC1964,"A Dornier 228 passenger plane was destroyed when it crashed near Viña del Mar Airport (KNA), Chile. Both pilots were killed.The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from Los Pelambres Airport to Viña del Mar. There it would pick up workers for the Los Pelambres mine.The airplane approached in poor visibility conditions. The ILS glideslope was inoperative so the crew conducted a non precision approach to runway 05. The aircraft descended below the minimum descent altitude, struck power lines and trees and crashed in a field."

He then flew to Vieques (VQS) without incident, and was returning to Culebra at the time of the accident. The airplane impacted the water and was destroyed."
154,ACC1967,"A Saab 340B turboprop suffered a runway excursion at Udon Thani Airport (UTH), Thailand. No injuries were reported.Nok Air Mini flight DD-8610 originated in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The airplane ran off the right side if the runway into the grass, causing the nose landing gear to collapse.It has been reported that the hydraulic pump failed before landing. The crew used the manual pump to extend gear and flaps. Landing was normal and when the airplane vacated the runway there was a loss of control of brakes and steering on the parallel taxiway. After the pilot stopped the aircraft using reverse thrust, he set the parking brake and shut down the engine. The aircraft continue move foreword out of the taxiway with a 3 degree down slope and hit a sign post, causing the collapse of the nose gear.The investigation is ongoing."
155,ACC1968,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 310, operated by MASwings, sustained substantial damage in an accident at Kudat Airport (KUD), Malaysia. The copilot and one passenger died, four others were injured.MASwings flight MH3002 operated on a domestic flight from Kota Kinabalu Airport (BKI) to Kudat. The captain was the pilot flying for this sector and the first officer was pilot monitoring. As the aircraft was approaching Kudat Airfield, Kudat Tower reported the weather conditions to be: wind at 270 degrees at 17 kts gusting 31 kts.The aircraft continued the approach on runway 04 and leveled off at 500 feet with flaps set at 10°. At this point the crew noticed that the approach for runway 04 had a strong tail wind. This was evident from the indicated airspeed observed by the crew which indicated 100 kts where the airspeed for flaps 10° should be 65kts. The windsock also indicated a tail wind. Noticing the approach for runway 04 was a tail wind condition, the crew decided to go around at a height of 500ft.Maintaining runway heading, the crew initiated a go around climbing to 1,000ft making a left tear drop and reposition for runway 22. On the approach for runway 22 the captain informed the first officer that if they could not land they would return to Kota Kinabalu.The aircraft was aligned with the centerline of runway 22 and 20° flaps was set. The aircraft continued to descend to 300ft. At this point the wind appeared to be calm as the aircraft did not experience any turbulence and the captain told the first officer that he was committed to land. Upon reaching 200ft the captain called for the flaps to be lowered to full down.As they were about to flare the aircraft to land, approximately 20ft above the runway, the aircraft was suddenly hit by a gust of wind which caused the aircraft to veer to the right with the right wing low and left wing high and the nose was pointing 45° to the right of runway 22.The crew decided to go around by applying maximum power; however the aircraft did not manage to climb successfully. The flaps were not raised and were still in the full flaps down position as the crew thought the aircraft was still low hence the flaps were not raised. The aircraft continued to veer to the right with right wing low and managed to only climb at a shallow rate. The aircraft failed to clear the approaching trees ahead and was unable to continue its climb because the airspeed was reducing. The presence of a full flaps configuration made it more difficult for the aircraft to climb. As the aircraft was on full power on both the engines, it continued to fly almost perpendicularly in relation to the runway and at a low height above the ground.The aircraft hit a tree top at the airfield perimeter fencing, disappeared behind the row of trees, hit another tree behind a house.It hit the right rear roof of the house, ploughed through the roof top of the kitchen, toilet and dining area, hit the solid concrete pillars of the car garage and finally hit the lamp post just outside the house fence. It swung back onto the direction of the runway and came to rest on the ground with its left engine still running. A woman and her 11-year old son who were in the living room at the time escaped unhurt."
156,ACC1969,"The aircraft, a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, was taking off from Likawage airstrip for a flight to Dar es Salaam. The pilot said that he applied power on brakes before the start of the takeoff run but the engine did not achieve the required takeoff power. He decided to initiate a takeoff run hoping that the engine would spool up to takeoff power under ram air. At around three quarters of the way down the runway the engine achieved takeoff power. The aircraft subsequently failed to respond to climb inputs and collided with trees located beyond the end of the runway. Fire broke out on the right wing and consumed a substantial part of the aircraft before it was extinguished. The pilot was injured but the passengers sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was destroyed by fire and impact with trees."
157,ACC1970,"A Cessna 525A, N368PK, experienced a bird strike to the right wing during climb from Lincoln Airport, NE (LNK). The airplane sustained substantial damage to the outer right wing spar. The pilot and copilot were uninjured. The positioning flight departed Lincoln from runway 36 and climbed to an initial altitude of 3,000 feet MSL and contacted Lincoln air traffic control departure. Departure control issued a climbing clearance to 10,000 feet MSL and a right turn to approximately 060 degrees. The flight crew made the right turn and began a climb to 10,000 feel MSL. During the climb and after passing approximately 6,400 feet MSL, the flight crew noted a flock of birds. The flight crew reported that they were unable to avoid the approximately 12-20 birds and struck one of them at the right outboard wing while the airplane was 7-8 miles northeast of the airport. The estimated indicated airspeed of the airplane at the time of the birdstrike was 200 knots. After noting the wing damage and verifying the engines, controllability, and overall airplane condition were operating normal, the flight crew informed air traffic control that they had experienced a bird strike and would need to return. They were issued vectors back to the longest runway, runway 36, where they landing without further incident."

160,ACC1973,"At approximately 18:20 hrs on 3 November 2013, the Channel Islands Air Search organisation was alerted to carry out a search for two fishermen who were in difficulties near Les Écréhous, a group of rocks north-east of Jersey, Channel Islands. The pilot, accompanied by the search director, and three observers, gathered at the aircraft's base at Guernsey Airport, and made preparations for flight. There was no moon and the Channel Islands were affected by poor weather, with strong southerly winds, low cloud, and poor visibility. The aircraft took off at 18:47 hrs and, taking account of the cloud base and visibility, the pilot levelled the aircraft at approximately 700 ft amsl on track towards the search area.When the aircraft was approximately six miles north of Jersey Airport, the right engine rpm began to vary, repeatedly reducing and then increasing. The observer seated to the right of the pilot, observed the fuel pressure fluctuating but this was not noticed by the pilot. The pilot selected the alternate intake air but the engine then stopped. The pilot feathered the propeller and then completed the engine shutdown checks. Following a brief conversation with the search director, the pilot turned the aircraft towards Jersey Airport and declared a MAYDAY to ATC, while the search director made a similar call on the maritime frequency. The pilot applied full power on the left engine and put the aircraft into a climb.The aircraft had climbed to approximately 1,100 ft amsl when the left engine rpm began to fluctuate before the engine ceased to produce power. The pilot informed ATC that the aircraft was ""going down"" and the search crew stowed their equipment. No attempt was made to re-start either engine.An offshore lifeboat operating nearby changed its course to be in attendance should the aircraft ditch. As the aircraft descended, the radio altimeter issued an alert prompting the pilot to switch on the landing lights and instruct the crew to brace. As it continued its descent the aircraft's landing lights suddenly illuminated ground ahead and the pilot manoeuvred for a touchdown.The north coast of Jersey is characterised by rocky cliffs and roughly undulating terrain, however, the aircraft's descent brought it towards one of the very few relatively benign areas suitable for a forced landing. Following a ground roll of 140 m, during which the left main landing gear collapsed rearwards, the aircraft's progress was halted when its nose lodged, in a gentle impact, in the base of a tree.The pilot and search crew were uninjured. After making the aircraft safe they made their way to nearby habitation, where they were met by emergency services personnel who had been dispatched to search for them.Initial examination of the aircraft revealed that both main fuel tanks were found almost full and the tip tanks were empty. Switches in the cockpit were found in the 'tip tank' position. It appears that the tip tanks had been selected on a flight the previous day and the selection had not been changed. At the commencement of the accident flight, each tip tank contained approximately 5-6 USG."
161,ACC1974,"Bearskin Airlines Flight JV311 crashed while on approach to runway 26 at Red Lake Airport, Ontario, Canada. Both pilots and three of the five passengers were killed in the accident. Flight 311 was a scheduled flight between Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, with stops in Sioux Lookout, Ontario, and Red Lake, Ontario. The flight from Thunder Bay and the subsequent departure from Sioux Lookout were uneventful. At 18:16, Winnipeg ACC cleared Bearskin 311 to the Red Lake Airport for the VOR/DME runway 26 approach, and advised the pilots to contact Kenora Flight Service Station (FSS).The descent checklist was carried out and, at 18:17, the crew advised Kenora FSS that they had been cleared by Winnipeg ACC for an approach to runway 26 at the Red Lake Airport. Because the crew were expecting to encounter visual conditions prior to landing, a full approach briefing was not carried out.The landing checklist was completed and, at 18:27, the crew advised Kenora FSS that they were 5 nautical miles (nm) on final approach for runway 26 at the Red Lake Airport. At 18:28, at approximately 500 feet above ground level and approximately 1.4 nm from the runway, the crew noted an aircraft malfunction but did not immediately identify the nature of it. Maximum power was applied to one or both engines, and the landing gear was initially selected up and then re-selected down before it could fully retract. The crew declared an emergency with Kenora FSS and unsuccessfully attempted to initiate a climb. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft veered and rolled to the left, descended, and struck trees with its left wing. The aircraft continued through the trees and struck a series of hydro lines that ran parallel to Ontario Highway 125, before coming to rest in a wooded area adjacent to the highway.A post-crash fire erupted."
162,ACC1975,"An Antonov 2R biplane sustained substantial damage in an accident during an attempted landing at Kamako, West-Kasaï, Democratic Republic of the Congo.The aircraft touched down 16 meters short of runway 12, bounced and came down 37 m down the runway.

163,ACC1976,"The aircraft, a Learjet 35A bound for Cozumel, Mexico, impacted the waters of the Atlantic Ocean about three miles northeast of Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (KFLL), Fort Lauderdale, Florida. All four aboard were killed.The airplane had just completed an air ambulance flight for Air Evac International from San Jose, Costa Rica to Fort Lauderdale, and was repositioning back to its base in Cozumel, Mexico.The airplane departed Fort Lauderdale Airport runway 10R about 19:50. After the aircraft climbed straight ahead over the ocean to about 2,200 ft and 200 knots groundspeed, the copilot requested radar vectors back to the departure airport due to an ""engine failure."" The controller assigned an altitude and heading, and the copilot replied, ""not possible,"" and requested a 180-degree turn back to the airport, which the controller acknowledged and approved. However, the airplane continued a gradual left turn to the north as it slowed and descended. At 19:52:34 the crew radioed ""Mayday, mayday, mayday"". The Miami Departure controller instructed the crew to turn left, heading 260 and continued to give vectors for an approach to runway 28R.During the next 3 minutes, the copilot requested, received, and acknowledged multiple instructions from the controller to turn left to the southwest to return to the airport. However, the airplane continued its slow left turn and descent to the north. The airplane slowed to 140 knots and descended to 900 ft as it flew northbound, parallel to the shoreline, and away from the airport. Eventually, the airplane tracked in the direction of the airport, but it continued to descend and impacted the ocean about 1 mile offshore, broke up and sank.According to conversations recorded on the airplane's cockpit voice recorder, no checklists were called for, offered, or used by either flight crewmember during normal operations (before or during engine start, taxi, and takeoff) or following the announced in-flight emergency. After the ""engine failure"" was declared to the air traffic controller, the pilot asked the copilot for unspecified ""help"" because he did not ""know what's going on,"" and he could not identify the emergency or direct the copilot in any way with regard to managing or responding to the emergency. At no time did the copilot identify or verify a specific emergency or malfunction, and he did not provide any guidance or assistance to the pilot.Examination of the left engine's thrust reverser system components after salvage found that the upper blocker door was attached to the reverser and found in a partially deployed position."
164,ACC1977,"A Beechcraft 1900C airplane, N575X, sustained substantial damage during landing at Badami Airport, 29 miles east of Deadhorse, Alaska. The airplane was operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) on-demand charter flight. There were no injuries. Instrument meteorological conditions were reported at the time of the accident. The flight originated at Deadhorse, Alaska, about 11:17. The captain reported that during landing, the main landing gear wheels impacted the elevated edge of the runway surface. The right main gear separated, and the airplane slid along the surface of the runway, sustaining substantial damage to the fuselage and right elevator. At the time of the accident, at 1232, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) at Badami Airport, Deadhorse, Alaska, reported in part, wind 120 degrees, at 30 knots, visibility, 1/2 statute miles with heavy blowing snow, broken clouds at 1,000 feet, temperature, -16 degrees F (-27 degrees C); altimeter, 29.60 in HG."
165,ACC1978,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, registered P2-SAH and operated by Tropicair, departed Kamusi for Purari River, Papua New Guinea at approximately 13:15 local time on a charter flight under the instrument flight rules (IFR). The aircraft was carrying a pilot and nine passengers. One of the passengers, in the right pilot seat, was a pilot about to begin training with the operator.Takeoff and climb from Kamusi were normal and the pilot levelled off at 9,000 ft above mean sea level and completed the appropriate checklist. Between Kamusi and Purari River the terrain is mostly flat and forest covered with areas of swampland and slow-moving tidal rivers. Habitation is very sparse with occasional small villages on the rivers. The weather was generally good in the area with a cloud base of 3,000 ft and good visibility between build-ups. Approximately two minutes into the cruise there was a loud 'pop' followed by a complete loss of engine power. After configuring the aircraft for best glide speed at 95 knots, the pilot turned the aircraft right towards the coast and rivers and completed the Phase 1 memory recall items for engine failure in flight. He was assisted by the passenger in the right pilot seat, who switched on the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) and began broadcasting 'mayday' on the area frequency. Checking the database in the Global Positioning System (GPS), the pilot found the airstrip at Kibeni on the eastern side of the Palbuna River. Kibeni airstrip is disused, uneven, and short but it was the only open ground in the area on which the pilot could attempt a forced landing. The pilot, assisted by the passenger next to him, tried unsuccessfully to restart the engine. The passenger continued to give position reports and to communicate with other aircraft. At about 3,000 ft AMSL the pilot asked for radio silence on the area frequency so he could concentrate on the approach to Kibeni airstrip, flying a left hand circuit to land in a south westerly direction. He selected full flaps during the final stages of the approach, which arrested the aircraft's rate of descent and caused it to float. The wheels contacted the ground three times but this did not slow the aircraft enough to enable the pilot to stop it before the end of the airstrip.In order to clear the trees between the airstrip and the river, the pilot elected to pull up on the control column. The aircraft became airborne again, damaging the crown of a coconut palm as it passed over the trees between the end of the airstrip and the river. The pilot turned hard left and pushed forward on the control column to avoid stalling the aircraft. He levelled the wings before the aircraft impacted the water. The aircraft came to rest inverted and partially submerged, and immediately filled with water. After a short delay while he gained his bearings under water, the pilot was able to undo his harness and open the left cockpit door. He swam to the surface, opened the door at the rear of the fuselage, and helped the surviving passengers to safety on the river bank. After approximately 20 minutes, villagers arrived in a canoe and transported the pilot and surviving passengers across the river.Pratt & Whitney Canada examined the engine and concluded that the engine power loss was caused by the fracture of one Compressor Turbine (CT) blade in fatigue, which resulted in secondary damage to the remainder of the CT blades and downstream components. The fatigue originated from multiple origins on the pressure side of the blade trailing edge. The root cause for the fatigue initiation could not be determined with certainty."
166,ACC1979,"ANA Flight NH4915, operated by ANA Wings, sustained damage in a lightning strike event near Fukue, Japan. There were no injuries.During the weather briefing prior to departure, the captain and the first officer noted that there was a wintry pressure pattern, a trough accompanied by cold air would pass through western Japan during the morning, there was no specific information indicating the possibility of lightning on the flight planned route of the aircraft. The DHC-8-400Q turboprop aircraft departed Fukuoka Airport, Japan at 09:03 hours local time on a flight to Fukue Airport. The captain was Pilot Flying.While the aircraft was cruising at an altitude of 12,000 ft, heading for Fukue Airport, the captain and the first officer visually observed white clouds with a top height of 11,000 ft, on its course. When the aircraft began to descend at around 09:24 in order to approach the airport, the observed clouds were not so thick as could be suspected to cause turbulence or lightning but were displayed on the weather radar display of the aircraft in a green color, indicating an area with weak rainfall. At around 09:30, while descending through the clouds at 5300 ft, the captain and the first officer observed a strong flash of light coming from the left fore side of the cockpit and heard a loud ""bang"" immediately after that.Afterwards, the captain and the first officer carried out checks to determine if there were any abnormalities. Although a wind noise was heard from the nose direction, no other abnormalities were identified.On the final approach to the airport, the aircraft exited the clouds, and landed at the airport at 09:37. After landing, the captain, the first officer and the mechanic carried out inspections on the aircraft, and consequently, the following were revealed:- Five dents occurred on the aft side outer skin of the upper left access panel on the nose,- Six rivet heads on the upper left access panel on the nose were burned, and- The aft latch of the upper right access panel on the nose, as well as the fore and aft latches of the upper left access panel on the nose were opened.The Company inspected the details of the damage of the aircraft, and confirmed that deformations had also occurred on the internal structure supporting the rear side outer skin of the upper left access panel on the nose."

The airplane sustained substantial damage. The pilot and two passengers were seriously injured, one passenger was fatally injured, and five passengers received minor injuries. The pilot stated that shortly after takeoff from runway 05, at an altitude of about 400 feet above ground level (agl), he began a left turn for a downwind departure. Shortly after passing 500 feet agl, he motioned toward the power lever to reduce power for the climb when he heard a loud ""bang"" followed by an immediate loss of engine power. The pilot continued the turn toward land, verified the fuel valves were on, and observed all engine gauges displaying ""zero."" The pilot realized the airplane was not going to make it to land, and rolled the wings level while broadcasting a mayday distress call. Shortly after, the airplane landed within open ocean water in a flat or slightly nose up attitude.All the passengers and the pilot exited the airplane through the rear right door, and the airplane remained on the water surface for approximately 25 minutes before it sank. One passenger swam to shore, and United States Coast Guard and Maui Fire and Rescue helicopters recovered the pilot and 7 passengers from the water about 80 minutes after the ditching.The passenger who died before the first responders arrived was found wearing a partially inflated infant life vest.  Anotherpassenger reported that he also inadvertently used an infant life vest, which he said seemed ""small or tight"" but ""worked fine."" If the pilot had provided a safety briefing, as required by regulations, to the passengers that included the ditching procedures and location and usage of floatation equipment, the passengers might have been able to find and use the correct size flotation device."
172,ACC1985,"A Cessna 525A CitationJet CJ2+ jet was damaged in a loss of control accident whilst on a flight from Leeds/Bradford Airport. The pilot and passenger were not injured.As the aircraft approached its cruising altitude of FL430, the indicated airspeed decreased to about 128 knots. The pilot then reduced the rate of climb to 500 ft/min. However, over the next 50 seconds, the speed gradually reduced by a further 10 kts.Close to FL430, the pilot checked his tablet to check the forecast. At that moment the aircraft pitched severely nose-down and rolled to the right, departing from controlled flight in a series of five 360° rolls to the right. The pilot briefly regained control before the aircraft stalled again and in the following recovery. The aircrafts wings were damaged in overload due to the +4.48g peak in acceleration, which was between the +3.6g ('limit' load) and +5.4g ('ultimate' load). The pilot returned to Leeds/Bradford at FL280 and made a successful landing."
173,ACC1986,"A Canadair Challenger 601 corporate jet, registered N115WF, was destroyed in a landing accident at Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE). The copilot was fatally injured; the captain and the passenger received serious injuries.The flight originated from the Tucson International Airport (TUS), Arizona, at 10:04 and was bound for Aspen.The departure and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. As the flight neared its destination, a high-altitude, terrain-limited airport, air traffic control (ATC) provided vectors to the localizer/distance measuring equipment (LOC/DME)-E approach to runway 15. About 12:10, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 290º at 19 knots (kts) with gusts to 25 kts. About 12:11, the flight crew reported that they were executing a missed approach and then requested vectors for a second approach. ATC vectored the airplane for a second LOC/DME-E approach to runway 15. About 12:21, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 330° at 16 kts and the 1-minute average wind was from 320° at 14 kts gusting to 25 kts.The initial part of the airplane's second approach was as-expected for descent angle, flap setting, and spoilers. During the final minute of flight, the engines were advanced and retarded five times, and the airplane's airspeed varied between 135 kts and 150 kts. The final portion of the approach to the runway was not consistent with a stabilized approach. The airplane stayed nose down during its final descent and initial contact with the runway. The vertical acceleration and pitch parameters were consistent with the airplane pitch oscillating above the runway for a number of seconds before a hard runway contact, a gain in altitude, and a final impact into the runway at about 6 g.The weather at the time of the accident was near or in exceedance of the airplane's maximum tailwind and crosswind components for landing, as published in the airplane flight manual.Given the location of the airplane over the runway when the approach became unstabilized and terrain limitations of Aspen, performance calculations were completed to determine if the airplane could successfully perform a go-around. Assuming the crew had control of the airplane, and that the engines were advanced to the appropriate climb setting, anti-ice was off, and tailwinds were less than a sustained 25 kts, the airplane had the capability to complete a go-around, clearing the local obstacles along that path.Both flight crewmembers had recently completed simulator training for a type rating in the CL-600 airplane. The captain reported that he had a total of 12 to 14 hours of total flight time in the airplane type, including the time he trained in the simulator. The copilot would have had close to the same hours as the captain given that they attended flight training together. Neither flight crew member would have met the minimum flight time requirement of 25 hours to act as pilot-in-command under Part 135. The accident flight was conducted under Part 91, and therefore, the 25 hours requirement did not apply to this portion of their trip. Nevertheless, the additional flight time would have increased the crew's familiarity with the airplane and its limitation and likely improved their decision-making during the unstabilized approach."
174,ACC1987,"A Gulfstream 200, N720QS, operated by NetJets Aviation, was substantially damaged when the auxiliary power unit (APU) access door opened in-flight near Savannah, Georgia. Both pilots were not injured. The post-maintenance test flight departed Savannah International Airport, GA (SAV) at 14:36. Prior to departure, the crew performed a preflight inspection and observed no anomalies. The crew described the takeoff as normal, and stated that as the airplane climbed through 16,000 feet at 280 knots, they experienced a momentary shudder. No other anomalies were observed, and the crew did not experience any abnormal handling characteristics with the airplane. Upon landing at SAV, the crew observed that the APU access door was open and bent, but remained attached. The door's lower locking tabs were in the down and locked position, and the side tabs were in the open position. The crew noted that the side tabs were ""bent as if torn away."" The lower portion of the rudder exhibited substantial damage due to contact with the access door."
175,ACC1988,"The aircraft, a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan (Blackhawk VY conversion), Trans Guyana Airways Flight 700, on a shuttle operation between Olive Creek and Imbaimadai airstrip, impacted wooded terrain in the Mazaruni area. The airplane was destroyed. The pilot and cargo handler suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft took off from Olive Creek at 10:54, carrying fuel and other supplies for gold mining operations.Two and a half minutes after takeoff the engine lost power. The aircraft lost height and impacted an undulating and heavily forested area. Since only three of the seven oil drums were secured, the remaining four shifted forward during the crash.In June 2013 the aircraft received a Blackhawk modification, which consisted among others of the installation of a factory new P&W PT6A-42A engine."
176,ACC1989,"An Antonov An-28, operated by East Wing, sustained substantial damage in a forced landing near Addis Ababa-Bole Airport, Ethiopia.The aircraft had departed Entebbe Airport, Uganda, on a ferry flight to Hodeidah, Yemen, with three crew members on board.After flying for about 4:30 hrs the right engine surged and flamed out. The flight informed the ATC of Addis Ababa-Bole Airport in Ethiopia, requesting a diversion there for an emergency landing. After flying for another 15 minutes, the left engine similarly surged and flamed out. The aircraft was about 15 km from the airport and was not able to reach the runway. The captain decided to make force landing. During the landing run over rough ground surface, the nose gear hit an obstacle, causing to be pushed into the cockpit. The aircraft continued moving forward, striking and killed three cattle. The left and right wing roots detached from the fuselage and both wing tips were damaged by the impact with the cattle and the ground."
177,ACC1990,"A Cessna 500 Citation I corporate jet sustained substantial damage in a bird strike accident near Roskilde, Denmark.The accident flight was a commercial ferry flight from Roskilde to Merville, France. After takeoff from runway 11 at Roskilde, the aircraft was established in climb with a nose-up pitch attitude of approximately 13-15°. Just before reaching the flap retraction altitude of 400 feet above ground level, the flight crew noticed ""something white"" in front of the aircraft.The commander, who was the pilot flying, immediately initiated an aircraft pitch increase, but almost simultaneously a ""bang"" was heard and a bump was felt in the aircraft, most likely coming from the underside of the aircraft. The flight crew observed large white birds below the aircraft.The flight crew realized that the aircraft had been hit by one or more birds, probably Mute Swans, and decided to leave the flaps at the takeoff setting of 15°.Cockpit indications did not show any abnormalities and the aircraft handling and controllability did feel normal by the flight crew.In order to return to Roskilde, the flight crew performed a visual traffic pattern and approach to runway 11, followed by a normal landing and roll-out.The aircraft taxied to the run-up area for runway 29, where an inspection performed by the fire and rescue service personnel revealed that fuel leaked from the left wing."
178,ACC1991,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter operated by Nepal Airlines was destroyed when it impacted a mountainside near Sandhikhark, Nepal. All 18 on board sustained fatal injuries.Flight RA183 was a domestic flight from Kathmandu to Jumla with a refueling stop at Pokhara. The airplane took off from Pokhara at 12:43. Upon leaving Pokhara Control Zone, the pilot in command realized that the direct track was not possible due weather and decided to proceed via a more southern track. During the flight the pilots were experiencing uncomfortable flying environment due to unfavorable weather conditions. Attempting to avoid the weather, the pilots had to fly up and down and changing the heading. Finally being unable to penetrate the weather ahead, the captain decided to divert to Bhairahawa, the nearest airport. However, the captain did not take into consideration the surrounding terrain and continued descent turning right. The aircraft initially slashed a small tree and finally impacted a ridge. Due to the heavy impact the left wing was first disintegrated and then the front part of the aircraft toppled over beyond the ridge with several subsequent impacts.The cockpit voice recorder showed that the copilot had warned the captain not to descend or turn.The wreckage was located the following morning at an altitude of 7190 feet (2192 m). There were no surivors."
179,ACC1992,"Jet2 flight 389 departed from Leeds/Bradford (LBA) at 08:05 UTC. The captain was Pilot Flying (PF). The en route part and descent towards Funchal (FNC), Madeira, were uneventful.There was a partially cloudy sky at Funchal with good visibility, surface wind was strong from 330° at 14 kts gusting to 24 kts, with variations in direction between 220° and 020°. Temperature was 15°C. The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 05 seemed normal until the point Rosario, when he began to notice effects of ""wind shear"" and coincident with the automatic altitude call of 50 feet, the aircraft developed a high sink rate. The PF continued with the approach and he attempted to arrest the rate of descent but the aircraft landed heavily and bounced to a height of about 8 feet and continued for about 300 meters.During the second contact with the runway, the tail of the aircraft struck its surface at a speed of about 140 kts. The PF was able to control the aircraft safely within the confines of the runway.A preliminary visual inspection showed some deformation of the outer surface of the fuselage and significant skid marks on the underside of the rear fuselage.Closer inspection, performed by maintenance services, revealed the existence of a deformed drain tube, some bent struts with five cracks found on two fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads sustained in the contact with the runway."

182,ACC1995,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, reportedly operated by Penas Air, sustained damage in a landing accident at Pogapa, Papua."
183,ACC1996,"A US Airways Airbus A320 sustained substantial damage in an aborted takeoff accident at Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL).Before pushback from the gate, the first officer, who was the pilot monitoring, initialized the flight management computer (FMC) and mistakenly entered the incorrect departure runway (27R instead of the assigned 27L). As the captain taxied onto runway 27L for departure, he noticed that the wrong runway was entered in the FMC. The captain asked the first officer to correct the runway entry in the FMC, which she completed about 27 seconds before the beginning of the takeoff roll; however, she did not enter the FLEX temperature (a reduced takeoff thrust setting) for the newly entered runway or upload the related V-speeds. As a result, the FMC's ability to execute a FLEX power takeoff was invalidated, and V-speeds did not appear on the primary flight display (PFD) or the multipurpose control display unit during the takeoff roll. Once the airplane was cleared for takeoff on runway 27L, the captain set FLEX thrust with the thrust levers, and he felt that the performance and acceleration of the airplane on the takeoff roll was normal. About 2 seconds later, as the airplane reached about 56 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), the flight crew received a single level two caution chime and an electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) message indicating that the thrust was not set correctly. The first officer called ""engine thrust levers not set."" According to the operator's pilot handbook, in response to an ""engine thrust levers not set"" ECAM message, the thrust levers should be moved to the takeoff/go-around (TO/GA) detent.However, the captain responded by saying ""they're set"" and moving the thrust levers from the FLEX position to the CL (climb) detent then back to the FLEX position. As the airplane continued to accelerate, the first officer did not make a callout at 80 KIAS, as required. As the airplane reached 86 KIAS, the automated RETARD aural alert sounded and continued until the end of the CVR recording. According to Airbus, the RETARD alert is designed to occur at 20 ft radio altitude on landing and advise the pilot to reduce the thrust levers to idle. The captain later reported that he had never heard an aural RETARD alert on takeoff, only knew of it on landing, and did not know what it was telling him. He further said that when the RETARD aural alert sounded, he did not plan to reject the takeoff because they were in a high-speed regime, they had no red warning lights, and there was nothing to suggest that the takeoff should be rejected. The first officer later reported that there were no V-speeds depicted on the PFD and, thus, she could not call V1 or VR during the takeoff. She was not aware of any guidance or procedure that recommended rejecting or continuing a takeoff when there were no V-speeds displayed. The captain stated that he had recalled the V-speeds as previously briefed from the Taxi checklist, which happened to be the same V-speeds for runway 27L. The captain continued the takeoff roll despite the lack of displayed V-speeds, no callouts from the first officer, and the continued and repeated RETARD aural alert. The airplane rotated at 164 KIAS. The captain had ""the perception the aircraft was unsafe to fly"" and that he decided ""the safest action was not to continue,"" so he commenced a rejected takeoff. FDR data indicate that the captain reduced the engines to idle and made an airplane-nose-down input as the airplane reached 167 KIAS (well above the V1 speed of 157 KIAS) and achieved a 6.7 degree nose-high attitude. The airplane's pitch decreased until the nosegear contacted the runway. However, the airplane then bounced back into the air and achieved a radio altitude of about 15 ft. The tail of the airplane then struck the runway surface, followed by the main landing gear then the nose landing gear, resulting in its fracture. The airplane slid to its final resting position on the left side of runway 27L.The operator's SOPs address the conditions under which a rejected takeoff should be performed within both low-speed (below 80 KIAS) and high-speed (between 80 KIAS and V1) regimes but provide no guidance for rejecting a takeoff after V1 and rotation. Simulator testing performed after the accident demonstrated that increasing the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent, as required by SOPs upon the activation of the ""thrust not set"" ECAM message, would have silenced the RETARD aural alert. At the time of the accident, neither the operator's training program nor manuals provided to flight crews specifically addressed what to do in the event the RETARD alert occurred during takeoff; although, 9 months before the accident, US Airways published a safety article regarding the conditions under which the alert would activate during takeoff. The operator's postaccident actions include a policy change (published via bulletin) to its pilot handbook specifying that moving the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent will cancel the RETARD aural alert."
184,ACC1997,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, N126AR, operated by Hageland Aviation Services impacted terrain in the Three Steps Mountain area about 60 km southeast of Bethel, Alaska. A post-crash fire erupted. Both pilots were killed.The flight was intended to be the first training flight of the newly hired second-in-command (SIC) pilot. The SIC was operating from the airplane's right seat during the training.The airplane departed Bethel Airport, Alaska, at 15:35. After departure, the airplane began a series of training maneuvers, consistent with normal operations. About 21 minutes into the flight, when the airplane was about 3,400 ft mean sea level, it began a steep descent and subsequently impacted terrain. An airplane performance study showed that the airplane reached a nose-down pitch of about -40 degrees and that the descent rate reached about 16,000 ft per minute. The NTSB determined that it is likely that the check airman simulated a pitch trim excursion and that the trainee, who lacked experience in the airplane type, did not appropriately respond to the excursion. The check airman did not take remedial action and initiate the recovery procedure in time to prevent the control forces from becoming unmanageable and to ensure that recovery from the associated dive was possible.The aircraft impacted frozen tundra and came to rest in an area of heavy willows."

190,ACC2003,"A Lockheed SP-2H, N4692A, was substantially damaged when the nose wheel landing gear collapsed during landing roll at theFresno Yosemite International Airport (FAT), Fresno, California. The airplane was registered to Minden Air Corporation and operated as Tanker 48 by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forestry Service.The captain reported that following an uneventful aerial drop, the flight was returning to Porterville. During the descent check, he noticed that the hydraulic pressure indicated 0 and that the first officer subsequently verified that the sight gauge for the main hydraulic fluid reservoir was empty. The first officer opened the jet engine doors successfully as the captain selected gear down with no response. The captain notified base personnel at Porterville of the situation, and informed them that they would be orbiting to the east of the airport to troubleshoot. The captain and first officer performed the emergency checklist, and verified that the nose wheel landing gear was extended. The captain stated that the first officer then installed the pin in the nose wheel landing gear as part of the emergency checklist.The flight diverted to Fresno due to a longer runway and emergency resources as both pilots briefed the no-flap landing procedure, airspeeds, and approach profile. As the flight continued toward Fresno, the flight crew informed Fresno Approach Control of the hydraulic system failure, and continued to perform the emergency gear extension checklist. The first officer extended the main landing gear using the emergency gear release, which resulted in three down and locked landing gear indications in the cockpit. As the flight neared Fresno, the first officer added 2 gallons of hydraulic fluid to the main hydraulic reservoir while the captain attempted to extend the flaps unsuccessfully. Subsequently, the flight landed normally on runway 26R. During the landing roll, the nose wheel landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest nose low.The first officer reported that following completion of the emergency nose gear extension checklist, he physically inserted the nose gear pin in place prior to the landing at Fresno.Examination of the airplane by representatives from the Forest Service revealed that the forward portion of the fuselage was structurally damaged.

Ten passengers survived the accident.Flight GE222 had departed from Kaohsiung International Airport (KHH) at 17:43 on a scheduled domestic flight to Magong Airport, Penghu Islands, Taiwan. The flight had been delayed from 16:00 hours because of poor weather as a result of Typhoon Matmo that was passing through the area. The flight arrived near the Penghu Islands at 18:11 and entered a holding pattern to the northeast. The Magong airport has a single runway 02/20. Runway 02 offers an ILS approach, while for runway 20 a VOR/DME approach is available.At 18:27 the following weather information was passed on to the crew: runway 02: wind from 210 degrees at 5 knots, gusting to 11 knots; runway 20 wind from 190 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 15 knots. Visibility was 800 meters.The crew then requested a runway 02 ILS approach and proceeded towards the south. At 18:43 a preceding UNI Air ATR-72-600, flight 647, requested a VOR approach to runway 20. This probably made the crew change their minds, since they subsequently also requested a VOR approach to runway 20. This was approved.

The aircraft continued to climb and levelled off at 8000 feet asl, where cruise power was set. The airspeed did not accelerate beyond 120 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), and the flight began to descend with cruise power set. At 06:59, the pilot contacted the Edmonton, Alberta, Area Control Centre (ACC) and requested a lower altitude, as he was unable to maintain 120 KIAS. Edmonton ACC cleared the flight to 6000 feet asl direct to Fort Simpson. During the controlled descent, airspeed continued to decline below 120 KIAS, even with the application of maximum continuous power. At 07:06, a request was made to Edmonton ACC to return to CYZF because of severe icing. Flight 223 was ultimately cleared to Yellowknife at 3000 feet asl. The pilot experienced periods of elevator buffeting and uncommanded forward pitch movements during the turn. He continued the descent in order to maintain 110 KIAS. Flap position remained fully up, as the pilot was concerned that movement would further affect tailplane effectiveness.At 07:17, the pilot advised Yellowknife Tower that the aircraft was in severe icing conditions and unable to maintain altitude. It was cleared to 2100 feet asl (minimum vectoring altitude). At 07:19, the pilot experienced a significant uncommanded pitch forward and advised ATC that they were unable to maintain 2100 feet asl; a Mayday was declared.At 07:20, when the aircraft was 300 feet above ground level, the pilot experienced a series of wing drops and an associated rate of descent of 1200 feet per minute at 100 to 110 KIAS. In response, the power lever was pushed fully forward, exceeding the maximum continuous rating of 1865 foot-pounds of torque. No flap selections were made.While still in darkness, the aircraft contacted the frozen surface of Great Slave Lake at 07:21, and continued moving for 2300 feet before it struck a rock outcropping with the nose and left main landing gear. The aircraft came to rest approximately 600 feet from the outcropping and 2900 feet from the initial touchdown point. There were no injuries to the occupants, but the aircraft was severely damaged. There was no post-impact fire.Passenger evacuation was ordered once the pilot had assessed the situation. Passengers attempted to open the main cabin door but were unable to do so. After several failed attempts to evacuate, the passengers succeeded in exiting via the left cockpit door with the aid of cockpit lighting."
206,ACC2019,"A Tropic Air Cessna 208 Caravan operating as Flight 281 experienced a runway overrun upon landing at the Belize City Municipal Airport (TZA) in Belize City and came to rest in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The right hand main gear collapsed as it ran into the water, causing the airplane to swing 180 degrees.The airplane sustained substantial damage and the six occupants onboard were not injured. Weather may have been a factor in the accident.The airplane had been delivered on November 19, 2014 after having been repaired by Aircraft Structures International Corp. following an accident in India. In May 2011 the aircraft, then registered VT-NES, suffered a runway excursion accident and fell into a ravine."
207,ACC2020,"The aircraft had departed Providenciales Airport for the short flight to Grand Turk. On selecting the landing gear down during final approach, the crew noted an 'unsafe' indication for the nose leg. Recycling the gear effected no change in the condition, so the co-pilot called ATC to advise them of the situation and to request permission for the aircraft to over-fly the airfield at 500 ft. This allowed ATC personnel in the tower to confirm that the nose landing gear had not extended. The captain then flew the aircraft in a holding pattern overhead the airfield while he considered his options. He decided to return to Providenciales as he considered that the airport there was better equipped for emergencies and it was also the maintenance base for the aircraft.After contacting the airfield the captain entered a hold approximately 15 nm away while he attempted to extend the landing gear manually in accordance with the Emergency Checklist. This once again resulted in the main landing gear extending, but the nose leg remained in the up position. The captain then called his companys Flight Operations department who sought advice from the maintenance team. They suggested conducting a 'touch and go' on the main wheels in an attempt to shake the nose leg into the down position. The captain performed this manoeuvre but to no avail. Considering he had explored all the available options, he then took the aircraft back into a holding pattern while he briefed the co-pilot and passengers for an emergency landing. The captain declared an emergency and advised the tower of his intentions. The aircraft landed on its main landing gear and, as the speed decayed, the nose lowered to the runway surface, causing abrasion damage to the underside of the nose cone and nose gear doors. The propeller tips also contacted the runway. The aircraft was met by airfield Fire Service vehicles but there was no fire and the occupants vacated the aircraft without injury."
208,ACC2021,"Southwest Airlines flight WN3118, a Boeing 737-76N, registration N7710A, encountered multiple bird strikes while on approach to Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Maryland. None of the passengers or crew members were injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight originated from San Antonio International Airport, Texas.The captain stated that while descending through about 2,500 feet on approach to land the airplane struck multiple birds. Inspection of the airplane after landing revealed substantial damage to the 178 forward pressure bulkhead and left wing fixed leading edge main rib."
209,ACC2022,"The pilot was planning to fly the aircraft from a private unlicensed airfield near Limerick City, Ireland to Gloucestershire Airport in the United Kingdom. The aircraft had been parked in the open overnight adjacent to the hangar.The pilot reported that the grass runway surface was wet but not unduly soft or frozen, with occasional spots of water-logging and mud. The wind was light and from an easterly direction making runway 15 the preferred runway direction for departure. Following the removal of engine and pitot covers, the engine was started and the aircraft positioned away from the hangar to an area at the beginning of runway 15. Following extension of full flap to permit proper inspection of the flap mechanisms, the engine was shut down and a pre-flight inspection was carried out. Engine start was completed and included a check of the propeller control to ensure the pitch changing mechanism was functioning correctly. Takeoff checks were completed from memory and the takeoff run was commenced on runway 15.With takeoff power applied the aircraft appeared to accelerate normally. The pilot used a soft field technique where aft pressure was applied to the control yoke and the nose-wheel was lifted just off the runway surface as soon as possible. With the aircraft well established in the takeoff run, the pilot felt that the aircraft was not accelerating as expected. As a reserve of take-off power was available, he applied maximum available engine power, however there appeared to be no appreciable increase in acceleration.The pilot realised that continuing the take-off in these circumstances was not safe and that stopping in the remaining runway length would likely result in an overrun. As he was familiar with the airfield he was also aware that any overrun would result in the aircraft entering the ditch at the end of the runway. With few options remaining at that point, the pilot attempted to overfly the ditch at the departure end of the runway with the intention of stopping the aircraft in the adjacent field. As it passed over the ditch, the aircraft made contact with fence posts embedded in the hedge sustaining significant damage to the left elevator and fuselage underside. The aircraft came to rest at the far boundary of the adjacent field, incurring damage to the engine and propeller. The pilot shut down the engine and was able to evacuate the aircraft unaided."
210,ACC2023,The pilots were practicing an engine out landing when one of the pilots forgot to lower the landing gear. The plane performed a belly landing and skidded over 200 meters on its belly before coming to a stop. There were no injuries.

213,ACC2026,An Antonov 2 of Olimp Air crash in Kazakhstan. Six of the seven occupants suffered fatal injuries.The airplane operated on a flight from Balkhash Airport to the Shatyrkul Mine. On board were three crew members and four employees of the Kazakhmys mining company. Visibility was poor at the time of the accident.
214,ACC2027,"A Beechcraft 1900 was destroyed in an accident shortly after takeoff from Miami Executive Airport, FL (TMB) in Florida. All four occupants sustained fatal injuries.The airplane had undergone routine maintenance in Miami and was returning to Venezuela at the time of the accident. An NTSB review of maintenance records revealed that the left engine propeller had been due for overhaul. It was removed and replaced with an overhauled propeller prior to the accident flight and the accident flight was the first flight after the overhauled propeller was installed on the left engine. The flight was cleared for takeoff at 14:36:45 hours local time. At 14:38:15, one of the pilots reported an ""engine failure"" to air traffic control. The controller asked the pilot if he would like to return to the airport and the pilot replied affirmative. The controller then offered a 180-degree turn to runway 9R and the pilot requested a left traffic pattern to runway 27L, which the controller approved; however, the airplane subsequently impacted a utility pole and terrain about 4,5 km west of the runway.The highest altitude recorded on radar was 300 feet. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the cockpit and cabin. It appeared that the no.1 engine prop feathered after takeoff and that the engine was shut down prior to the accident."
215,ACC2028,"The Antonov 26 force landed in a field following a loss of engine power on takeoff from Quelimane Airport, Mozambique. The aircraft came down about 150 from the runway.The aircraft involved in operations to help flood victims in central and northern Mozambique."
216,ACC2029,"An Antonov 32 transport plane of the National Air Force of Angola was destroyed in a landing accident at Malange Airport (MEG), Angola.The An-32 operated on a flight from Saurimo to Luanda, carrying 47 soldiers and crew on board. En route, the airplane developed an unspecified ""technical failure"", forcing the crew to divert to Malange Airport. The runway was unlit and the airplane suffered a runway excursion. All 47 on board were able to leave the aircraft before it was consumed by fire."
217,ACC2030,"A DHC-8-400 operated by SpiceJet sustained damage in a landing accident at Hubli Airport (HBX), India.The aircraft operated flight SG1085 from Bangalore to Hubli and departed at around 13:00 UTC. At the time the visibility reported for Hubli was 10 km. When the aircraft came in contact with Mangalore ATC, the controller cleared the aircraft direct to Hubli and informed heavy rains and thunder showers over Hubli with visibility 3000 m. At around 60 nm from Hubli, the weather reported was heavy rain and visibility 4000 meters. ATC cleared aircraft for the NDB approach runway 26, however the captain preferred to carry out a VOR/DME trial procedure for runway 26. The descent was commenced and about 25 nm short of Hubli, ATC again advised visibility has reduced to 3000 m due heavy rain and thunderstorm.Thereafter the crew decided to hold over Hubli until the weather improves. Twenty minutes into holding, ATC again informed that visibility has improved to 4000 m in moderate rain.Subsequently descent was requested by the pilot for runway 26. The captain stated that he had established visual reference with runway at about 6 nm on the final approach course. The crew also selected wipers on short final to have a better visibility. The aircraft landed normally. The captain stated that after touch down and reducing power, he was concentrating on the far end of the runway. As the runway was wet, he did not realize that the aircraft was drifting to the left of the center line. He further mentioned that he selected full reverse on both the engines to maintain the aircraft on the center line however the aircraft veered toward the left side of the runway and in the process overran the runway edge light, after which the left main landing gear collapsed. The propeller blades hit the runway surface and sheared off from the root attachment. The captain maneuvered the aircraft however the nose wheel tyre failed under over load conditions and the nose landing gear collapsed as well. Subsequently, the aircraft exited the runway on the left side on kutcha (dried mud) and came to a final stop at round 52 meters away from the runway center line. The cockpit crew shut down the engines and the electrical power supply and cockpit door and announced evacuation. The cabin crew opened and the cabin doors on the right for evacuation. There was no injury to any of the occupants on board the aircraft. There was no postaccident fire."
218,ACC2031,"The Cessna 208B, N106BZ, collided with terrain and trees during an off airport forced landing in Verdigris, Oklahoma. The force landing was a result of a loss of engine power during an en route climb. The pilot received minor injuries and the passenger was not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The aircraft was owned and operated by the pilot as post maintenance test flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight. The flight originated from the Tulsa International Airport, Oklahoma, at 15:00.The airplane was equipped with a Honeywell TPE331 engine which had been installed about 9 flight hours prior to the accident. The pilot stated they were climbing to 11,000 feet when he noticed a decrease in engine torque with a steady exhaust gas temperature (EGT). As the torque started to drop even more, the EGT also began to decrease.The pilot attempted to fly to a nearby airstrip, but was unable to maintain sufficient altitude. He then chose a field in which to land. Shortly after touching down, the airplane contacted trees, completely severing the left wing from the fuselage and partially severing the right wing from the fuselage."
219,ACC2032,"Two Boeing 737-8AS (WL) aircraft operated by Ryanair suffered a wingtip strike while taxying at Dublin Airport, Ireland. The aircraft involved were flight FR812 to Edinburgh, U.K. (EI-DYA) and FR7312 to Zadar, Croatia (EI-DWE). FR7312 was taxiing via LINK 2 for a departure on runway 28. Flight FR812 was also taxiing via LINK 2 but for a departure on runway 34. FR7312 was instructed to proceed to taxiway F1 and to hold short of LINK 1. The aircraft halted at the beginning of taxiway F1. The second aircraft was instructed to turn right onto taxiway A to hold short of runway 34. This instruction included a caution regarding wingtip clearance with the aircraft ahead. At that point the winglet of FR812 (EI-DYA) impacted the starboard elevator of FR7312 (EI-DYA). EI-DYA's winglet was severed with a portion sliced off by EI-DWE."
220,ACC2033,"Jet Airways flight 9W2423 was a scheduled service from Delhi to Varanasi and Khajuraho. The aircraft departed from Varanasi Airport at 12:45 local time and the flight was normal till touch down on runway 19 on Khajuraho Airport. The captain was pilot flying and co-pilot was carrying out duty of Pilot Monitoring. The captain carried out an ILS approach and landing on runway 19 at Khajuraho Airport. At touchdown the aircraft pitch was 4.39° with a vertical deceleration of 1.65G and a touchdown speed of  120 kts (Vref -4kts). During landing roll, 15 seconds after touchdown, at speed 36 knots the left main landing gear aft trunnion pin broke and the aircraft started deviating to the left of the center line. The aircraft came to stop on the runway with damage to the left hand main landing gear and resting on the no.1 engine, nose and right hand landing gear. Hydraulic fluid spillage occurred due to damage to the main landing gear. An emergency evacuation was carried out on the runway. All four main doors, escape slides and four emergency over wing exits were opened. However, the passengers used two escape slides (L1 and R1) for evacuation. One cabin crew member received minor injuries (bruises) during evacuation.The runway was closed after the accident as aircraft became disabled on the runway.  The disabled aircraft was removed from the runway at 16:45 hours."
221,ACC2034,"The Carson Air Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II was operating as flight 66, a weekday cargo flight between Vancouver International Airport (CYVR) and Fort St. John (CYXJ), British Columbia, Canada, with planned stops in Prince George (CYXS) and Dawson Creek (CYDQ).On the morning of the occurrence, CA66's first officer arrived at the airport at approximately 06:00. The first officer appeared to be in good spirits and spent about 5 minutes in the flight planning room before going to the aircraft to prepare it for that day's flights. The captain arrived at approximately 06:15 and went directly to the flight planning room to begin preparing the morning's flight plan. He appeared to be in a positive state of mind and spent a few minutes speaking with other company pilots who were also preparing to operate flights. He used a company computer to access weather information and placed a telephone call to NAV CANADA to file an instrument flight rules flight plan. No abnormal behaviour was observed by anyone with whom he had contact. The captain then walked to the aircraft and spent about 10 minutes in the flight deck before assisting the first officer with loading the flight's cargo. Final flight preparations were carried out by both flight crew members before they boarded the aircraft and started the engines, at about 06:45.At 07:03, CA66 began its take-off run. The aircraft lifted off after an approximate ground-run distance of 2800 to 3000 feet. This was within the expected normal performance for the aircraft type.Shortly after takeoff, CA66 contacted CYVR terminal departure control and was cleared to 9000 feet above sea level (ASL). A short time later, the air traffic controller assigned the flight a northbound heading. At 07:07, CYVR terminal departure control instructed CA66 to change radio frequencies and contact CYVR centre control. Upon initial contact with CYVR centre control, while climbing through 7500 feet, CA66 was again cleared to the aircraft's final flight planned altitude of flight level 200. At 07:08, the crew acknowledged a clearance to climb to flight level 200; this was CA66's last radio transmission. One minute and 20 seconds later, while climbing through an altitude of 8700 feet on an assigned heading of 350° magnetic, the aircraft disappeared from secondary surveillance radar displays at air traffic control.CA66's radar track, from the time it first became visible on radar at 07:02 until a steep descent toward ground, was approximately 7 minutes. The track showed an apparently routine climb from CYVR, at an average climb rate of 1500 feet per minute. Aircraft speed during the climb increased gradually until a ground speed of approximately 185 knots was reached.The last 3 radar returns from CA66 showed the aircraft beginning an abrupt, steep descent. At 07:09, a radar return showed that the aircraft was at 8700 feet; this was the highest altitude it reached. The 2 subsequent radar returns showed that the aircraft had dropped rapidly to 7600 feet and then 5000 feet while continuing in the direction of flight. There were no further returns.During the initial stage of the descent, the aircraft pitched down at about 6° per second, and its vertical acceleration reached -0.6g. The descent to 5000 feet likely occurred within 10 to 14 seconds. During that period, the aircraft's descent rate exceeded 30 000 feet per minute, and aerodynamic forces caused structural disintegration of the aircraft (in-flight breakup). There was no Mayday call or other communication from the aircraft during this period.Deteriorating weather conditions with low cloud and heavy snowfall hampered an air search; however, aircraft wreckage was found on steep, mountainous, snow-covered terrain by ground searchers at approximately 16:45. Both pilots had been fatally injured.Investigation showed that the captain had 0.24% blood alcohol content [BAC]. To obtain this, the captain would have had to consume approximately 17 to 20 standard drinks over a 12-hour period. An autopsy also identified focal severe coronary artery atherosclerosis and both steatosis and hepatitis in the captains liver. Finding these conditions in a 34-year-old person suggests excessive alcohol consumption over a significant period.The captain had recently applied for the position of Vancouver base chief pilot for the companys cargo operation. On 26 March 2015, the company advised him that the position had been awarded to another candidate. Around the same period, on 24 March 2015, 20 days before this accident, a first officer who had been having symptoms of depression and psychosis deliberately flew a Germanwings Airbus A320 into terrain, killing all on board.Although there were several coincidental factors, the investigation could not make any conclusions about the captains predisposition to committing an intentional act. Other scenario's like pitot system blockage or crew incapacitation were also considered, but deemed not very probable."
222,ACC2035,"The aircraft was undertaking target towing operations for a military exercise and was recovering the target whilst flying in an assigned danger area over the English Channel.With the target approximately 40 m from the aircraft, the target winch accelerated rapidly and the target struck the leading edge of the wing before detaching and travelling over the wing. Although, the launcher and the droop leading edge on the wing were damaged, the aircraft landed safely. The target winch is powered by a turbine, and the speed of the turbine is controlled by vent doors. The target winch had oversped due to a fault with the closed limit switch on the vent doors which prevented the doors from closing."
223,ACC2036,"A US-2 seaplane of the Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force's Fleet Air Wing 31, suffered substantial damage while training in the Pacific Ocean about 40 km northeast of Ashizuri Cape, Kochi prefecture. One of the four engine was missing, and at least one of the floats under the wing was broken. Subsequent images show the aircraft floating nose down in the sea. Four crew members were injured."
224,ACC2037,"An Airbus A400M Atlas military transport plane was destroyed when it crashed near Sevilla Airport (SVQ), Spain during a test flight. Two of the six crew members survived the accident.The aircraft took off from runway 09 at 12:54 hours local time. The pilot, co-pilot, a mechanic and three engineers were conducting a test flight from Sevilla Airport (SVQ). The aircraft was built at the Airbus plant at Sevilla and was intended for the Turkish Air Force. It was the maiden flight after assembly.Shortly after takeoff three of the four engines became stuck at high power. Initially the three engines did not respond to the crews attempts to control the power setting in the normal way. Pilots then succeeded in reducing power only after selecting the thrust levers to idle. Then the engines remained stuck at idle. In an attempt to return to the airport, the aircraft struck powerlines, impacted a field and burned.An Airbus official after the accident stated that engine control software was incorrectly installed during final assembly of the aircraft. This led to engine failure and the resulting crash."
225,ACC2038,"The Antonov 2 biplane was destroyed in an accident in the Azov District, Rostov Oblast, Russia. The aircraft operated on a skydiving flight and just one of the 13 occupants was injured.After takeoff the engine cylinder head temperature rose to 280°C, forcing the pilot to return to the airfield. The aircraft lost altitude and made a forced landing in a field near the eastern boundary of the airfield. A fire erupted and consumed the aircraft."

Upon landing, the plane suffered a runway excursion. The wings of the plane were twisted, causing the engines to strike the ground.Three passengers sustained minor injuries."
227,ACC2040,"A Learjet 35, N80PG, call sign ""Riptide 80"", and contracted by the United States Navy, was substantially damaged during landing rollout, following a return to the airport after an unsafe nose landing gear indication at Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport (PHF), Newport News, Virginia.Before departure, the pilot and copilot completed a preflight inspection of the airplane and found everything to be normal. After taking off without incident, the flight crew started running the after takeoff checklist and the pilot moved the landing gear selector handle to the up position. The crew then felt and heard a loud ""clank"" in the nose of the airplane and observed that the red or unsafe nose gear light had illuminated; recycling the landing gear handle had the same result. As the flight crew returned to the departure airport, they selected the landing gear handle to the down position and received three green landing gear down indications and completed the before landing checklist; the air traffic controller advised that the nose landing gear appeared to be straight. During the landing, the airplane touched down on the main wheels first, but once the nosewheel touched down and weight was on the nose landing gear, the airplane suddenly turned sharply 30° to 40° to the left and application of right rudderdid not counter the turn. The airplane then partially traveled off the left side of the runway pavement, its left main landing gear struck a concrete runway edge-light base, then the airplane turned about 180° from its original direction of travel and came to rest on the left side of the runway about 1,500 ft from the end of the runway."

229,ACC2042,"A Bombardier DHC-8-315, JA727B operated by the Japan Coast Guard (JCG) took off from Hanamaki Airport  at 13:58 local time for a training flight. The captain, who was an instructor, sat in the right seat and the trainee in the left seat for training to obtain the type rating for First Officer certification in the Japan Coast Guard. The final part of the training was a  flap up landing at Sendai Airport, Japan. The captain and the trainee completed the flap up landing checklist just before the arrival at Yuriage (a visual reporting point of Sendai Airport) and the captain told the trainee that if the pitch angle (nose-up angle) exceeded 6°, corrective control would have to be performed by pushing the control column forward. Vref (reference speed for landing) was 126 kt. The aircraft entered the traffic pattern of runway 09 and landed around 15:58.Although the trainee made the main landing gear touch down near the aiming point marking for the runway 09, he felt it took a great deal of time to lower the nose. This time the captain on the right seat pushed the control column forward since he feared a tail strike. Then the nose landing gear touched the ground with stronger impact than usual (+1.47 g). In. Both the captain and the trainee were not aware of irregularity of the aircraft in landing roll, therefore they continued taxi and the aircraft arrived at the apron at around 16:05.After the engines were shutdown, the nose landing gear was found to be damaged in post-flight inspection by the on-board mechanic. Afterward, detailed inspection was conducted, which revealed abrasion marks on the lower part of the nose landing gear, damage on components of the nose landing gear, and deformation of the forward fuselage skins of the airframe."

234,ACC2047,"The float equipped DHC-3T Turbine Otter aircraft, operated by Promech Air, was destroyed when it impacted steep, mountainous tree-covered terrain about 25 miles northeast of Ketchikan above Ella Lake in the Misty Fjords area of Alaska. The pilot and eight passengers were killed.The accident airplane was the third of four Promech-operated float-equipped airplanes that departed at approximate 5-minute intervals from a floating dock in Rudyerd Bay. The accident flight and the two Promech flights that departed before it were carrying cruise-ship passengers who had a 12:30 ""all aboard"" time for their cruise ship that was scheduled to depart at 13:00. The sightseeing tour flight, which the cruise ship passengers had purchased from the cruise line as a shore excursion, overflew remote inland fjords; coastal waterways; and mountainous, tree-covered terrain in the Misty Fjords National Monument Wilderness.Promech pilots could choose between two standard tour routes between Rudyerd Bay and Ketchikan, referred to as the ""short route"" (which is about 52 nautical miles, takes about 25 minutes to complete, and is primarily over land) and the ""long route"" (which is about 63 nm, takes about 30 minutes to complete, and is primarily over seawater channels). Although the long route  was less scenic, it was generally preferred in poor weather conditions because it was primarily over water, which enabled the pilots to fly at lower altitudes beneath cloud layers. Route choice was at each pilot's discretion based on the pilot's assessment of the weather. The accident pilot and two other Promech pilots (one of whom was repositioning an empty airplane) chose the short route for the return leg, while the pilot of the second Promech flight to depart chose the long route. The accident flight encountered deteriorating weather conditions with terrain becoming obscured by overcast clouds with visibility restricted in rain and mist.Although the accident pilot had climbed the airplane to an altitude that would have provided safe terrain clearance had he followed the typical short route (which required the flight to pass two nearly identical mountains before turning west), the pilot instead deviated from that route and turned the airplane west early (after it passed only the first of the two mountains). The pilot's route deviation placed the airplane on a collision course with a 1,900-ft mountain, which it struck at an elevation of about 1,600 ft mean sea level. In the final 2 seconds of the flight, the airplane pitched up rapidly before colliding with terrain. The timing of this aggressive pitch-up maneuver strongly supports the scenario that the pilot continued the flight into near-zero visibility conditions, and, as soon as he realized that the flight was on a collision course with the terrain, he pulled aggressively on the elevator flight controls in an ineffective attempt to avoid the terrain."
235,ACC2048,"The Beechcraft C-99, N6199D, aborted takeoff at the Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah after experiencing a flight control malfunction shortly after liftoff. The two commercial pilots were uninjured and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. The pilots reported that after a normal start and taxi the airplane was cleared to takeoff from runway 16L. The airplane rolled down the runway and the pilot in command rotated the airplane about 100 knots. Immediately, the airplane yawed to the right and the right rudder pedal was at the floor. The copilot did not note anything abnormal with the engines and instruments. Both pilots applied pressure to the left rudder pedal, however, the pedal barely moved. The PIC then manipulated the rudder trim, however, that also did not reduce the right yaw. He jockeyed the throttles and attempted to land the airplane back onto the runway. The airplane touched down onto the left side of the runway and the airplane remained difficult to control; the left landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid to a stop on its left wing."
236,ACC2049,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter float plane sank off Kuredu Island Resort, Lhaviyani Atoll, Maldives following a landing accident. All 14 occupants survived the accident.The airplane departed the sea plane base at Male International Airport (MLE) at 16:33 hours local time (11:33 UTC). The aircraft landed at Komandoo at 17:10. Four passengers disembarked at Komandoo and 166 lb of luggage (3 suitcases from the cabin and 1 hand luggage from the aft baggage compartment) were offloaded from the aircraft. The passengers that disembarked at Komandoo were seated in the first and the second row of double seats.The second sector of the flight was Komandoo-Kuredu with an approximate flight duration of five minutes. The aircraft departed Komandoo at approximately 17:25 and the co-pilot was Pilot Flying on this sector.The new take-off mass of the aircraft for departure at Komandoo, in accordance with the flight release, was 11,240 lb. 11 passengers (5 female, 4 male and 2 child), 613 lb of luggage and 435 lb of fuel remaining on board. The take-off at Komandoo was normal as per the crew members. Once airborne, the copilot briefed the captain on the approach and landing area selection. The co-pilot stated that she was taking a North West bound line with Kuredu on the right side of the aircraft. The descent checks were completed shortly after and the aircraft joined the pattern on left downwind. The co-pilot initially requested for 10 degrees of flap followed by 20 degrees of flap on base, with speeds reducing to 75-80 knots. The crew did not recall any anomalies throughout this portion of the flight.In preparation for the landing, on final approach, the co-pilot requested the flaps at the fully down position and propeller levers forward. Immediately after the selection of flaps, the nose of the aircraft started to rise and the aircraft started to vibrate. The co-pilot stated that she was no longer able to control the aircraft at this stage and transferred the controls to the PIC.When the captain took over the controls, the aircraft was passing at approximately 300 ft, in a pitch up attitude. The captain stated he saw the stall warning light on and the aircraft was in a right bank going into a spin at this stage.The captain then applied full left rudder, moved the control column forward and put the power levers to idle. The nose of the aircraft however continued to rise. The captain then moved the flaps to the fully up position. The captain reported gaining a small degree of control at this stage but the aircraft impacted the sea before he could regain full control of the aircraft.On initial impact the left float detached. The aircraft then bounced and landed on the right float causing the right float to also detach from the aircraft. The right float was, however, trapped between the airframe and the engine for several minutes.Once the aircraft settled down, the captain gave the command for evacuation. The co-pilot and the cabin crew coordinated the evacuation and all the passengers and crew were able to escape through the left passenger door before the aircraft submerged completely. The captain was the last to leave the aircraft, after making sure that all passengers and other crew had evacuated the aircraft and that everybody had life jackets.With both floats detached from the aircraft and the right float still trapped, the aircraft stayed afloat until all passengers and crew escaped. At the same time, the aircraft started tilting left causing water to rush inside and started sinking. The aircraft continued sinking, banking left, flipped over then sank to the bottom of the sea. The wreckage was found the next day approximately 3 km southeast of Kuredu Resort at a depth of 36.5 m."

240,ACC2053,"The An-2 aircraft was prepared to conduct several aerial application flights from an airstrip in the vicinity of a farm in Stancuta commune, Romania.Onboard were the pilot and an aeronautical technician  who occupied the pilot's seat on the right.The take-off on the S-N direction was normal in the first part. The take-off run was short - approximately 100 m, according to a witness - under the conditions of a gusty wind from the easterly direction. During the initial climb, at a height of about 15-20 m, the aircraft began to lean to the left and descend slightly. During this turn in descent, bank angle continued to increase, the aircraft flying with the left wing at very low height above the aircraft parked towards the northern end of the airstrip. Observing that the pilot was not taking any avoiding action, the technician tried instinctively to turn the control yoke to the right. According to his statement the yoke was blocked.With the engine still running in take-off mode, the aircraft continued to descend, and after passing the parked aircraft, it hit the ground with the propeller and the left wing tip. The impact of the wing tip determined the aircraft to pivot to the left and make a hard contact with the ground.An early fire was extinguished by witnesses arrived at the accident site.Both occupants suffered serious injuries. Later on, the pilot died due to multiple traumatic injuries, and the passenger required a long hospitalization period due to the injuries suffered.The aircraft was totally destroyed."
241,ACC2054,"Two Let L-410 aircraft (registrations OM-SAB and OM-ODQ) crashed near Vratec, Slovakia, following a mid-air collision.

243,ACC2056,"The CP-140 Aurora was taking off from Greenwood Canadian Forces Base, Nova Scotia, on a transit mission to Iqaluit, Nunavut, in support of Operation Qimmiq. Thunderstorms had recently passed over the airport and the ground surfaces were wet. During the takeoff roll, the crew observed a flock of birds heading towards the runway. Seeing a conflict and concerned about the risk of collision, the aircraft commander directed the pilot flying to abort the takeoff. During the abort procedure, when the pilot flying selected full reverse on all four propellers, both propellers on the left side of the aircraft went into full reverse; however both propellers on the right side of the aircraft continued to produce some forward thrust. The crew was not successful at keeping the aircraft on the runway and it departed off the left side of the runway approximately 1000 feet before the end. The propellers contacted a Runway Distance Marker and a Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) light. The aircraft plowed through the soft earth and the nose gear collapsed, causing the inside propeller on the right side of the aircraft to strike the ground and break away from the engine. All personnel on board exited the aircraft safely and only minor injuries were incurred."

246,ACC2059,"The pilot of a Swearingen SA227-DC Metro 23 aircraft, registered VH-HPE, was conducting a scheduled freight run from Brisbane, to Emerald, via Thangool Airport, Queensland.Approaching Thangool, the pilot conducted a Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) arrival with a left circuit onto runway 28, touching down at 05:45 hours, just before first light.Shortly after touchdown, and with all landing gear wheels in contact with the ground, the pilot saw the glimpse of an animal flash from left to right in front of the aircraft. At the time, the aircraft was travelling at about 80 kt. The right propeller then struck the animal, later identified as a small kangaroo. The pilot reported that following the large bang associated with the propeller striking the animal, there was a lot of vibration throughout the aircraft, but no abnormal engine indications.The pilot continued the landing roll, and used ground idle rather than reverse thrust to slow the aircraft.The pilot taxied the aircraft to the parking bay, shut down the engines, then carried out an external inspection and found that one of the propeller blades attached to the right engine was twisted. The pilot was not injured.Following the incident, the operator replaced the right engine and propeller and arranged for the original engine to be further assessed by engineering staff.The next day, a Beechcraft B200 Super King Air operated by the Royal Flying Doctor Service was involved in a similar accident when it struck a kangaroo on landing at Thangool."
247,ACC2060,A Beechcraft 300 Super King Air was damaged in a landing accident at Rotterdam/The Hague Airport (RTM) in Netherlands.The aircraft landed gear-up on runway 24 and slid 625 meters before coming to rest.

248,ACC2061,"During the landing roll, the aircraft struck a kangaroo, resulting in substantial damage.The Beech B200 aircraft, VH-FDB, was on a medical retrieval mission from Townsville to Barcaldine Airport, Queensland. As the aircraft touched down in the early hours of the morning, at about 01:41 local time, the pilot caught a last moment glimpse of theanimal before the aircraft struck a small kangaroo. The pilot reported that engine indications were normal, with no noticeable vibration as they completed the landing roll and then shut down the left engine while on the runway. They then taxied clear of the runway using the remaining engine. The strike caused damage to the three propeller blades attached to the left engine and disabled the aircraft.The aircraft was ferried to Rockhampton Airport, QLD (ROK) on September 8. A test flight was performed at Rockhampton on September 11. The aircraft was back in service shortly after that."

The Airbus A321 took off from runway 23L at Düsseldorf at 12:12 hours (10:12 UTC). During takeoff one of the main landing gear's tires failed. Debris punctured the right hand wing. The aircraft leveled off at FL270 at which point the crew likely became aware of the damage. A descent was initiated at 12:41 and the flight diverted to München, where it landed safely on runway 26R at 13:21 hours.The aircraft was repaired and was back in service on October 1, 2015."
251,ACC2064,"The Cessna 550 Citation Bravo corporate jet taxied at Lismore Airport for a flight to Baryulgil, New South Wales. The flight crew consisted of a captain and copilot, who were the only occupants of the aircraft.The flight crew did not detect anything abnormal during the taxi and take-off roll, until the captain attempted to rotate the aircraft to the take-off pitch attitude. When the aircraft had achieved the required rotate speed, the captain applied the normal backpressure on the control column to achieve a standard rate of rotation, and the aircraft did not rotate. The captain then applied full backpressure and reported that the controls felt very heavy. Neither the captain nor the copilot detected any change in the aircraft's pitch attitude or any indication of pitch-up on the attitude direction indicator.The captain rejected the take-off, applied full braking and reverse thrust, but the aircraft overran the runway. The nose landing gear detached from the aircraft about 50 m beyond the end of the sealed runway, and the aircraft came to rest in long grass and mud. The aircraft sustained substantial damage, and the captain and copilot were uninjured.The aircraft did not accelerate normally as the acceleration was retarded by drag associated with rolling friction. This was indicative of partial brake pressure remaining during the take-off run. The partial brake pressure was possibly due to the parking brake being selected on at the holding point with enough pressure to retard aircraft acceleration during the take-off, but not sufficient to prevent the aircraft reaching rotate speed.Furthermore, the nose-down moment generated by the partial brake pressure probably prevented the aircraft rotating sufficiently to become airborne, despite normal nose-up elevator deflection.Heat in the brakes due to partial pressure during the take-off run may have reduced their effectiveness when the captain rejected the take-off, contributing to the runway overrun."
252,ACC2065,"The Buffalo Airways Curtiss C-46A (C-GTXW) was operating as flight 525 from Yellowknife, NT (YZF) to Norman Wells, NT (YVQ). While en route, approximately 140 nautical miles southeast of Norman Wells at 6500 feet above sea level, the crew noticed a drop in the right engine oil quantity indicator in conjunction with a propeller overspeed. The propeller pitch was adjusted to control the overspeed however, oil quantity indication continued to drop rapidly. A visual confirmation of the right engine nacelle confirmed that oil was escaping via the engine breather vent at an abnormally high rate. The right propeller speed became uncontrollable and the crew completed the ""Prop overspeed drill"". However, the propeller did not feather as selected. Several additional attempts were made to feather the propeller before it eventually feathered. The engine was secured and the shutdown checklist completed. The crew elected to divert to Tulita, NT (ZFN), but quickly determined that the descent rate would not permit that as an option. The only other option for diversion was Déline, NT (YWJ) where weather was reported at half a mile visibility and 300 feet ceiling. An emergency was declared with Déline radio. BFL525 was able to land at Déline however, the landing gear was not selected down to prevent further loss of airspeed resulting in a belly landing approximately midpoint of runway 08. The aircraft continued off the end of the runway coming to a stop approximately 700 feet beyond the threshold. The crew evacuated the aircraft sustaining no injuries however, the aircraft was destroyed. Buffalo Airways initial investigation revealed the engine oil scavenge pump had failed."
253,ACC2066,"A Lockheed C-130J Hercules operated by the United States Air Force  crashed at Jalalabad Airport, Afghanistan.The 11 occupants of the aircraft, six U.S. service members and five civilians, were killed, along with three persons on the ground.The plane was assigned to the 774th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, part of the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing.The crew flew a successful mission from Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, to Jalalabad Airfield. While conducting engine running on-load/offload operations at Jalalabad Airfield, the pilot raised the elevators mounted to the horizontal stabilizer by pulling back on the yoke. This provided additional clearance to assist with offloading tall cargo. After a period of time in which the pilot held the yoke by hand, he placed a hard-shell night vision goggle (NVG) case in front of the yoke to hold the elevator in a raised position.However, because the pilots were operating in darkened nighttime flying conditions and wearing NVGs, neither pilot recognized and removed the NVG case after loading operations were complete or during takeoff. Once airborne, the aircraft increased in an excessive upward pitch during the takeoff climb. The co-pilot misidentified the flight control problem as a trim malfunction, resulting in improper recovery techniques. The rapid increase in pitch angle resulted in a stall from which the pilots were unable to recover. The aircraft impacted approximately 28 seconds after liftoff, right of the runway, within the confines of Jalalabad Airfield.The aircraft struck the ground, a perimeter wall and a guard tower, which resulted in all personnel onboard the aircraft being killed, along with three Afghan Special Reaction Force (ASRF) members assigned to the tower."
254,ACC2067,"Beech 200 Super King Air G-BYCP was planned to operate a non-commercial flight from Stapleford Aerodrome to RAF Brize Norton with two company employees on board to pick up two passengers for onward travel. The captain occupied the left seat and another pilot occupied the right. The second occupant worked for the operator of G-BYCP but his license was valid on Bombardier Challenger 300 and Embraer ERJ 135/145 aircraft and not on the King Air.The planned departure time of 08:15 hrs was delayed because of poor meteorological visibility. The general weather conditions were fog and low cloud with a calm wind. At approximately 08:50 hrs the visibility was judged to be approximately 600 m. At approximately 09:15 hrs the visibility was at least 1,000 m and the pilot decided that conditions were suitable for departure.The planned departure was to turn right after takeoff and intercept the 128° radial from Brookmans Park VOR (BPK) heading towards the beacon, and climb to a maximum altitude of 2,400 ft amsl to remain below the London TMA which has a lower limit of 2,500 ft amsl. The aircraft took off at 09:21 hrs and was observed climbing in a wings level attitude until it faded from view shortly after takeoff.After takeoff, the aircraft climbed on a track of approximately 205°M and, when passing approximately 750 ft amsl (565 ft aal), began to turn right. The aircraft continued to climb in the turn until it reached 875 ft amsl (690 ft aal) when it began to descend. The descent continued until the aircraft struck some trees at the edge of a field approximately 1.8 nm southwest of the airport. The pilot and passenger were both fatally injured in the accident, which was not survivable."

256,ACC2069,"A Learjet 35A, LV-ZSZ, was damaged beyond repair in a takeoff accident at San Fernando Airport, Argentina. Both crew members escaped uninjured.In preparation for a positioning flight to Río Gallegos the crew failed to connect an inverter, a component of the electrical system that converts the direct current from 28V to an alternating current of 115V, prior to starting engine no.1. This was then rectified.At 09:34 the aircraft taxied to the threshold of runway 05 for departure. The copilot was Pilot Flying while the experienced captain was Pilot Monitoring.Takeoff clearance was received at 09:40 and the power levers were advanced. During the takeoff roll the copilot noticed that the no.1 engine N1 reached a value of 101% instead of 95% like the no.2 engine. At that point the aircraft had already traveled 380 m. It began to drift to the right of the runway centreline. The copilot decided to abort without voicing his intentions. he brought back the power levers to idle and began applying brakes. At this point, LV-ZSZ had traveled approximately 980 meters from the start of the take-off run.The right engine power decreased to 30-40% N1 while the left engine continued at a value over 101% N1. The captain then took over control. Differential braking was applied to steer the aircraft back towards the runway centreline. Thrust reversers were deployed briefly but the aircraft ran off the side of the runway. The aircraft impacted with a ditch located 80 meters from the runway, causing the undercarriage to break away.  After coming to rest with both engines now at 20% N1, the engine were shut down.As a result of the impact, part of the left tip tank fuel tank had separated, causing a fire that destroyed the aircraft.The most likely cause of the uncommanded acceleration and subsequent overspeed condition was a contamination of retained particles present within the fuel control unit (FCU). The contamination was a short-lived random condition, as evidenced by the fact that after about 30 seconds the power lever regained control of the left engine."

260,ACC2073,"The pilot and owner of the aircraft planned to fly his Eclipse 500 from Kuruman back to his home base at Cape Town, South Africa.He decided to make a detour and land at Lanseria to refuel. He met with an associate there and handed a suitcase as well as a briefcase to the secretary of the person he visited. He indicated that his wife would come and pick it up at some stage and gave her his wifes name and contact number with instructions to call her at 10:30 hours. The aircraft departed Lanseria Airport at 08:21 and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL360. The last radio contact with the flight was in the vicinity of Kimberley. The aircraft entered the FACA FIR (Area Control Centre) airspace without any communication from the pilot. During the course of these events, Air Traffic and Navigation Services tried in vain on all frequencies to make contact with the aircraft. Meanwhile, the Eclipse began to deviate from the planned route.At 10:37 the aircraft was observed to commence with a right turn, during which the height of the aircraft varied by 2000 feet, remaining between FL350 and FL370. The aircraft completed a 360° turn to the right and immediately commenced with a second right-hand turn. After it had completed the second 360° turn, it was observed to fly in an easterly direction for a brief period, during which the aircraft was observed to have climbed to an altitude of FL376, after which it descended and again entered into a right-hand turn at 10:44 at an altitude of FL330.The aircraft completed the third right-hand turn at 10:47 at an altitude of FL305. After completing the turn, it immediately entered into a fourth right-hand turn at an altitude of FL326 and a speed of 377 knots. The aircraft completed the 360° turn at 10:48 at FL317. The aircraft was then observed flying in an easterly direction for a period of approximately 4 minutes when again it entered into a right-hand turn at 10:52 at FL321 and a speed of 290 knots. From the radar footage this orbit was observed to be very tight, as the aircraft was observed to have completed the 360° turn at 10:53 at an altitude of FL335 and a speed of 446 knots. The last time the accident aircraft was observed on radar was at 10:55 when it was at an altitude of 12300 feet, a speed of 396 knots and a heading of 008°.At 10:55 the aircraft was intercepted by a Saab Gripen supersonic military jet from the South African Air Force (SAAF), which had been dispatched from Air Force Base Overberg. The Gripen pilot could not get close enough to the aircraft to observe whether the pilot of ZS-DKS was conscious or not. The Eclipse jet spiralled towards the ground in a left wing low attitude until it impacted the terrain. Shortly after the aircraft had departed Lanseria, the pilot's wife was contacted by SMS about the bags. It appeared she was not aware why the bags were left at Lanseria for her and stated she had no plans of going there. The investigators reported that it was not uncommon for the pilot to drop of bags during his company travels like this, but in this case it remained unexplained why he took a detour to Lanseria to drop of the bags."
261,ACC2074,"Wasaya Airways flight 127 was to be the first of three cargo trips in the Cessna 208B Caravan (registration C-FKDL) planned from Pickle Lake Airport, Ontario, Canada to Angling Lake/Wapekeka Airport, Ontario. The first flight was planned to depart at 09:00.The pilot went to the Wasaya apron and conducted a pre-flight inspection of C-FKDL while a ground crew was loading cargo. The pilot returned to the hangar and received a briefing from the station manager regarding the planned flights. The pilot was advised that the first officer assigned to the flight had been reassigned to other duties in order to increase the aircraft's available payload and load a snowmobile on board.The pilot completed and signed a Wasaya flight dispatch clearance (FDC) form for WSG127, and filed a copy of it, along with the flight cargo manifests, in the designated location in the company operations room. The FDC for WSG127 showed that the flight was planned to be conducted under visual flight rules (VFR), under company flight-following, at an altitude of 5500 feet above sea level (ASL). Time en route was calculated to be 66 minutes, with fuel consumption of 413 pounds.The pilot returned to the aircraft on the apron. Loading and fueling were complete, and the pilot conducted a final walk-around inspection of C-FKDL. Before entering the cockpit, the pilot conducted an inspection of the upper wing surface.At 08:54, the pilot started the engine of C-FKDL and conducted ground checks for several minutes. At 08:58, the pilot advised on the mandatory frequency that WSG127 was taxiing for departure from runway 09.WSG127 departed from runway 09 at 09:00, and, at 09:01, the pilot reported on the  mandatory frequency that the flight was airborne. The flight climbed eastward for several miles and then turned left toward the track to  mandatory frequency. At about 3000 feet ASL, WSG127 briefly descended about 100 feet over 10 seconds, and then resumed climbing. At 09:05, the pilot reported that WSG127 was clear of the mandatory frequency zone.WSG127 intercepted the track to Angling Lake and climbed northward until the flight reached a peak altitude of about 4600 feet ASL at 09:08:41, and then began descending at 09:08:46. At 09:09:16, the flight made a sharp right turn of about 120° as it descended through about 4000 feet ASL. At 09:09:39, the descent ended at about 2800 feet and the aircraft climbed to about 3000 feet ASL before again beginning to descend. At approximately 09:10, WSG127 collided with trees and terrain at an elevation of 1460 feet ASL during daylight hours."
262,ACC2075,"The aircraft, a Beechjet 400A, collided with a snowplow while landing at the Telluride Regional Airport, Colorado, USA. The pilot, co-pilot, five passengers, and the snowplow operator were not injured and the airplane was substantially damaged during the accident. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time. The flight departed Monterrey, Mexico, with a planned stop in El Paso, Texas, en route to Telluride, Colorado.Prior to departure from Monterrey, the crew obtained preflight information, including NOTAMs for the planned route of flight. The NOTAMs for Telluride (KTEX) noted several runway closure times; however, none of the closures were valid for the period during which the flight would arrive at KTEX.The flight departed El Paso at 12:20 MST and the flight crew discussed the weather conditions at their destination airport, including concern that the weather maybe below minimums and may not allow for a landing. The Montrose Regional Airport (KMTJ), Colorado, was discussed as an alternate destination. As the flight neared their destination, the crew was in contact with a Denver en-route/center controller. The crew also listened to the Telluride's airport automated weather station.At 13:48, the controller asked the pilots to advise him when they had the weather and NOTAMS for KTEX, adding that another airplane just attempted an approach into KTEX, but had to execute a missed approach. The pilot reported that they received the weather information and planned to make the approach. The controller responded by giving the flight a heading, saying this would be for the descent and sequence into the airport.At 13:50, the airport operator entered a NOTAM via computer closing the runway (effective 13:50) for snow removal, and the airport operator proceeded onto the runway. At 13:58, the controller cleared the accident airplane for the approach to the airport. The pilot then cancelled his flight plan at 14:02 with the airport in sight. The crew did not change radio frequency to the airport's common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for traffic advisories.During the landing, the crew did not see the snowplow on the runway until it was too late to avoid a collision."
263,ACC2076,"The Cessna 208B Grand Caravan airplane, N540ME, sustained substantial damage after impacting terrain about 6 miles southwest of the Anaktuvuk Pass Airport, Alaska. Of the eight people on board, the pilot and four passengers sustained serious injuries, and three passengers sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the Anaktuvuk Pass Airport at the time of the accident. The flight departed from the Fairbanks Airport, about 10:30, destined for Anaktuvuk Pass. The pilot stated that he was flying along the John's River about 2,500 feet msl, 500 feet above ground level (agl) while en route to Anaktuvuk Pass Airport (AKP). About 10 miles from the airport, he began to climb to airport traffic pattern altitude and maintain a flight track on the east side of the river valley to conduct a straight-in approach to runway 2 at AKP. Although some ice was present on the windshield, the deice/anti-ice equipment was operating as designed, and the windshield hot plate remained free of contamination. He stated that due to the overcast skies and snow covered ground, a flat light condition was present.The aircraft impacted an area of snow-covered tundra, at an elevation of about 2,500 feet msl. The top of the ridge where the airplane impacted is at an approximate elevation of 3,000 feet msl. From the initial point of impact, the airplane traveled about 300 feet before coming to rest in an upright position. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings. Immediately following the accident, a passenger utilized a cellular phone to call for rescue from Anaktuvuk Pass residents. About 20 minutes after the call, the airplane was located and rescue personnel began extricating passengers and transporting them via snow machine to Anaktuvuk Pass for medical attention."
264,ACC2077,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan suffered substantial damage in a runway excursion accident at Hooper Bay Airport, Alaska.The pilot reported that he aligned the airplane on final approach with what ""appeared"" to be the runway with a small snow berm on both the left and right sides. The left main landing gear touched down first, and then the airplane came to an abrupt stop a few feet to the right of the runway.A postaccident examination of the airframe revealed substantial damage to the right wing.The pilot reported that there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation."
265,ACC2078,"A Cessna 525 CitationJet CJ1 was destroyed following a loss of control, an airframe in-flight breakup and impact with a snow covered field near Cedar Fort, Utah. Both occupants died in the accident.Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the personal cross-country flight from Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah, about 09:50, with an intended destination of Tucson International Airport, Arizona.The pilot contacted the SLC departure controller at 0951:59 and reported that he was climbing through 7,500 ft mean sea level (msl) for 10,000 ft. The controller then cleared the pilot to climb to and maintain Flight Level 230 (FL230), and to delete speed restrictions; the pilot confirmed the clearance. At 0952:21, the controller instructed the pilot to maintain 14,000 ft, to delete all speed restrictions, and asked him what speed he was climbing at; the pilot confirmed the clearance and stated that he was climbing at 200 knots (kts).At 0955:01, while approaching 14,000 ft the pilot reported that he had a failure with his Flight Management System (FMS), that he was ""switching to NAV for a second,"" and would be exceeding the assigned altitude. This was followed by an unintelligible transmission. At 0955:16, the controller instructed the pilot to descend and maintain 14,000 ft and to fly his present heading. About 10 seconds later, the pilot advised the controller that he had an autopilot failure, and requested a climb to visual meteorological conditions. The controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain FL180. At 0955:47, the pilot responded by confirming the climb to FL180. The controller then asked the pilot if he needed assistance. The pilot did not immediately respond, and the controller asked him a second time. At 0956:16, the pilot responded ""negative,"" saying that he was ""just trying to get to clear skies,"" and was climbing to FL180. The pilot stated that his ""number 2"" was working, and that his ""altitude"" had failed. The pilot concluded the transmission by saying, ""...so, uh, my number two is working, climbing to one eight thousand.""At 0956:32, the controller advised the pilot that traffic would be crossing above him at FL190, and that it was important that he level the airplane at FL180; the pilot replied, ""We'll be watching."" At 0956:45, the controller advised the pilot of two areas of light precipitation directly ahead of the airplane, and asked the pilot if he would need vectors to clear the weather. At 0956:59, the pilot responded that he would appreciate any vectors possible. Shortly thereafter, at 0957:06, the controller asked the pilot to ""...paint a picture for me of where you think the clearest skies would be. I can vector you wherever you need to go."" At 0957:12, the pilot replied that he was heading to TUS, his altitude would not hold, and that he was hand flying the airplane. About this time, radar showed the airplane beginning a right turn from its previously-established southerly heading to a southwesterly heading, though the airplane had neither been cleared to do so by the controller nor had the pilot informed the controller of the deviation. About 0957:20, the pilot transmitted that he would appreciate any vectors possible. About 15 seconds later, the controller advised the pilot that he was showing him at 17,500 ft, directed the pilot to fly his present heading, and stated that the airplane would be clear of the precipitation in about 4 miles. About 17 seconds later, the pilot transmitted, ""...ok, MAYDAY. I do need to get up higher. I am losing different instruments. I'd really like to get clear of weather."" At 0958:01, the controller issued the pilot a clearance to climb and maintain FL230, which the pilot confirmed. About 0958:26, the controller amended the previous clearance and instructed the pilot to climb to and maintain FL310, which the pilot initially confirmed, but shortly thereafter stated, ""...yeah. I can't even dial that in. Still climbing, passing twenty thousand, so I'm just going to be reading it out to be sure my second is operating correctly.""At 0958:46, the controller stated that he was showing the airplane climbing through 20,200 ft, and asked the pilot if he wanted to continue to TUS; the pilot replied, ""That is affirmative."" At 0958:53, when the airplane was at 20,700 ft, the controller issued the pilot a no-gyro turn to the left for vectors to the southeast; this occurred about 1 minute 41 seconds after the airplane had turned southwest. Radar data showed that the pilot initiated a right turn from a southwesterly heading at an altitude of 20,700 ft. At 0959:12, the airplane reached an altitude of 21,300 ft. msl, and was still in the right turn. At 0959:13, the controller stated, ""November one bravo x-ray. I show you in a right turn. Can you turn left?"" At 0959:17, while climbing out of 21,300 ft, the pilot replied that he was ""trying to climb.""About 0959:47, the controller advised the pilot that he had lost the airplane's altitude readout, and asked the pilot the airplane's altitude. There were no further transmissions received from the pilot. Between 0959:49 and 0959:58, the airplane descended from an altitude of 21,300 ft to 16,000 ft, with its rate of descent during this time increasing from 9,600 ft per minute (fpm) to 36,000 fpm.The airplane's wreckage was located in open, flat pasture ground, about 1 nautical mile southwest of Cedar Fort, Utah, and about 28 nm south-southwest of SLC. A survey of the accident site revealed that the linear debris path of wreckage extended for about 1 nm on a west to east orientation."
266,ACC2079,"The pilot of a Cessna 208 Caravan amphibian aircraft, registered VH-WTY was conducting a series of charter flights in the Whitsunday region of Queensland, Australia.The pilot was conducting his third flight of the day when the aircraft departed Hamilton Island Airport at about 14:15 local time with 10 passengers on board. The tour included a scenic flight over the Great Barrier Reef for about 50 minutes before heading to Chance Bay, on the south-east tip of Whitsunday Island, about 11 km north east of Hamilton Island Airport. Following a water landing at Chance Bay, the group was to spend 90 minutes at the beach before a short flight back to Hamilton Island. The tour was originally planned to include a landing at Whitehaven Beach, however wind conditions at the time required the water landing be altered to Chance Bay.The aircraft approach Whitsunday Island from the north and conduct an orbit about 2 km north of Whitehaven Beach at about 15:10, before heading toward Whitehaven Beach. It flew over the southern end of Whitehaven Beach and the strip of land that separates it from Chance Bay.The pilot advised that he flew over the western end of Chance Bays main beach in order to conduct a visual pre-landing check of the bay. The pilot noted the positions of various vessels moored in the bay to determine the best taxi path to the beach. During this fly-over, the pilot also noted the sea state and observed evidence of wind gusts on the water surface. The pilot then initiated a right downwind turn toward the landing area. The approach was from the south with the intent to land in the most suitable location within the designated landing area and then taxi to the beach.The pilot reported setting up for landing at about 50 ft above the water and then delayed the landing in order to fly through an observed wind gust. Passenger video footage indicated that, during the subsequent landing, WTY bounced three times on the surface of the water. After the second bounce, with WTY getting closer to the beach and terrain, the pilot increased engine power and initiated a go-around. The third bounce, which occurred almost immediately after the second, was the most pronounced and resulted in the aircraft rebounding about 30 to 50 ft above the water. While increasing power, the pilot perceived that the torque was indicating red, suggesting an over-torque for the selected propeller configuration. Noticing that the climb performance was less than expected with the flaps at 30°, the pilot stopped increasing power and reduced the flap to 20°.As the aircraft climbed straight ahead towards a saddle, climb performance was still below the pilots expectations and he assessed that WTY would not clear the terrain. In response, the pilot turned right to avoid the surrounding rising terrain. The aircraft clipped trees during this turn, before colliding with terrain and coming to rest in dense scrub about 150 m from the eastern end of the main beach, near the top of the ridge. The pilot promptly advised the passengers to exit and move away from the aircraft. Some of the 11 people on board suffered minor injuries but all were able to quickly leave the aircraft. There was no post-impact fire."

268,ACC2081,"A Viking Air DHC-6 Twin Otter 400, operating Tara Air flight 193, was destroyed in an accident in the Myagdi district, Nepal. All 23 on board suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft departed at 07:50 hours local time from Pokhara Airport (PKR) on a domestic 20-minute flight to Jomsom Airport (JMO), Nepal. The copilot acted as Pilot Flying, the captain as Pilot Monitoring during the flight. En route the flight deviated to the left and climbed to 12000 feet to avoid clouds. Over the Ghorepani area the GPWS began to sound. The aircraft was flying through clouds with a little visibility in between and a descent to 10000 feet was initiated. At 10200 feet the GPWS sounded again but the captain responded not to worry about it.The captain was used to hearing these warnings in normal flight, so it became a habit to disregard the warnings. About one minute before the accident the captain took over control and initiated a climb. The aircraft impacted a mountainside at 10700 feet, coming to rest at an elevation of 10982 feet.According to a statement by the airline, the aircraft crashed near Tirkhe Dungha, Dana VDC of Myagdi district."
269,ACC2082,"A Boeing 767-300F, N305UP, operated by United Parcel Service (UPS) as flight 916 was substantially damaged following a tailstrike during landing on runway 03 at the Albuquerque International Sunport Airport (ABQ), New Mexico. Neither of the 2 flight crew were injured. The flight originated from the Louisville International Airport (SDF), Kentucky.The airplane sustained damage to a 23 foot long section of lower fuselage skin, 4 fuselage stringers, 5 fuselage frames, 3 floor stringers and the tail skid. The replacement of the frames and stringers was considered a major repair.According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer the pilot monitoring for the flight from SDF-ABQ. Ground operations were normal in SDF and no aircraft loading or Weight and Balance discrepancies were noted. The climb, cruise, and descent portion of the flight were uneventful. Weather conditions at ABQ prior to arrival were reported as visual conditions, with wind from 090 at 20 knots gusting to 29 knots. The target approach speed used was 146 knots. The crew was vectored to the ILS approach to runway 03 and joined the localizer and glideslope using the autopilot. The autopilot was then disengaged at 1103 feet Height Above Touchdown (HAT) and at 1000 feet HAT the approach met all UPS Stabilized Approach criteria with the aircraft fully configured at flaps 30, gear down, and speed 145 knots. At 500 feet HAT the approach continued to meet all stabilized approach criteria with speed 146 knots. Flight data indicated that the crosswind component at this point was 23 knots from the right.At 158 feet above touchdown the approach met all stabilized approach criteria and the captain disconnected the autothrottles. UPS guidance recommends use of the autothrottle until 50 feet above touchdown. From this point on the approach until touchdown, the aircraft pitch attitude began to increase as the airspeed slowly decreased. Flight Data indicates that the thrust levers were at a reduced thrust setting when the autothrottles were disconnected and remained at that setting until touchdown. At 1.75 seconds from touchdown the airspeed had decayed to 129 knots and the aircraft pitch had increased to 7.2 degrees. The crosswind had also decreased and was now 13 knots from the right. At touchdown the airspeed was 128 knots and pitch attitude 8.4 degrees. The tailskid impacted the runway at touchdown followed immediately by the lower aft fuselage as the pitch attitude increased momentarily to 8.6 degrees. Initial tailskid impact occurred at approximately 800 feet from the runway threshold.The crew reported that they encountered a 10 knot wind loss just prior to touchdown and landed firmer than normal, but didn't suspect that they had struck the tailskid."
270,ACC2083,"An Antonov 26 cargo plane, operated by True Aviation, crashed in shallow waters of the Bay of Bengal shortly after takeoff from Cox's Bazar Airport (CXB), Bangladesh. Three Ukrainian crew members died in the crash and another was critically injured. The aircraft operated a scheduled cargo flight from Cox's Bazar to Jessore in Bangladesh. The on board cargo consisted of 802 boxes of shrimp weighing 4800 kg.The flight crew requested startup clearance at 02:58 UTC. The aircraft was then cleared to taxi to runway 35 via taxiway S. Takeoff clearance was given 03:05 UTC. During takeoff a drop in oil pressure in the torque meter system of engine no.1 caused the engine to lose power the cruise mode. The captain decided to continue takeoff. Immediately after becoming airborne the pilot reported an engine failure and requested for immediate return back to Cox's Bazar Airport. He was advised by ATC to report left hand down wind. Within 60 seconds after takeoff the no. 1 lost power completely.The captain initially tried to maneuver the aircraft to land on runway 17 (departure runway, opposite direction), but was unable to line up with the runway.The crew decided to continue on a right hand downwind at around 1000 feet with a IAS of 300km/h in clean configuration. The aircraft turned to final and fully configured for landing and stable at around 3.5 NM from the runway. But at 1.2 NM for reasons unknown the captain decided to go around and climbed to 400-500 feet. ATC advised the captain to report left hand down wind. But there was no response from the crew. The aircraft had impacted the shallow waters on the coast, 3 km West of the airport."

272,ACC2085,"A Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operated by flydubai as Flight FZ981 from Dubai, impacted airport terrain during a second approach attempt in bad weather to Rostov-On-Don Airport in Southern Russia. The airplane was destroyed and the 55 passengers and 7 crew fatally injured.Flight 981 departed Dubai at 18:37 hours UTC on March 18. The en route part of the flight was normal. The flight arrived near Rostov and the crew performed a manual approach to runway 22 with the autopilot disconnected. Weather conditions were poor with a cloud base at 630 meters, wind 230 degrees at 13 meters per second, maximum 18 meters per second, light rain shower, mist, severe turbulence and moderate windshear.At 22:42 UTC (01:42 local time) in the course of the initial approach at a height of 340 meters (1115 feet), the flight received a windshear alert. The flight crew decided to go around and then continued to a holding pattern waiting for improved weather conditions.The flight left the holding pattern at 00:28 UTC (03:28 LT) and descended towards Rostov for another approach to runway 22. As the crew were proceeding with another manual approach, they decided to go around again at a height of 220 meters (721 feet), 4,5 km before the runway after receiving another windshear alert. They initiated a climb with a vertical speed of up to 20 m/s and setting the engines to maximum takeoff/go-around (TOGA) thrust.In the course of the go-around the crew set flaps to 15° and retracted the landing gear.At the height of 1900 ft (approx. 600 m) after reaching the pitch angle of 18° the pilot flying pushed on the control column, which led to a decrease in vertical acceleration of up to 0.5, increase in forward speed and, consequently, automatic retraction of flaps from 15° to 10° at a speed of over 200 knots.The short-term decrease in engine thrust within 3 seconds resulted in decreasing speed and flaps extension to 15°, although the following crew inputs to regain maximum takeoff/go-around thrust led to speed increase and reiterated automatic flaps retraction to 10°. The flaps remained in the latter configuration until the impact.The pilot flying, by pulling up the control column, continued climbing with a vertical speed of as much as 16 m/s.At a height of 900 m there was a simultaneous control column nose down input and stabilizer nose down deflection from -2,5 deg (6,5 units) to +2,5 deg (1,5 units). The FDR recorded a nose down stabilizer input from the stabilizer trim switch of the control wheel lasting 12 seconds, while the CVR record contains a specific noise of rotation of the trim wheels located on both sides of the central pedestal. As a result the aircraft, having climbed to about 1000 m, turned into descent with a negative vertical acceleration of -1g. The following crew recovery actions did not allow to avoid an impact with the ground.The aircraft hit the runway about 120 m from the threshold with a speed of over 600 km/h and over 50 degrees nose down pitch.

The aircraft took off from runway 04 at Puerto Gaitán Airport about 06:22 hours local time. Upon rotation of the aircraft, the crew heard an explosion from the no.1 (left) engine. The pilot noticed that the no.1 engine cover had torn away, hitting the propeller blades. The aircraft began to lose height and speed and the crew decided to perform an emergency landing in a field. The aircraft struck the ground causing detachment of the propellers and parts of the aircraft. After coming to rest, a post-impact fire started that consumed much of the aircraft. An inspection of the engine revealed that one of the cylinder heads had broken away. Parts were found near the end of the runway."

277,ACC2090,"A BN-2T Islander aircraft impacted terrain short of the runway at Kiunga Airport in Papua New Guinea, killing all 12 persons on board.The aircraft took off from Tekin Airport at 13:56 hours local time on a VFR flight to Kiunga. On board were the pilot-in-command and 11 passengers: eight adults and three infants. In addition to the passengers and their baggage, the aircraft was carrying a significant quantity of vegetables. The weather at Kiunga was reported to be fine. As the aircraft entered the Kiunga circuit area, the pilot cancelled SARWATCH with Air Traffic Services (ATS). The pilot did not report an emergency to indicate a safety concern. Witnesses reported that during its final approach, the aircraft suddenly pitched up almost to the vertical, the right wing dropped, and the aircraft rolled inverted and rapidly ""fell to the ground"". It impacted the terrain about 1,200 metres west of the threshold of runway 07. The impact was vertical, with almost no forward motion. The aircraft was destroyed, and all occupants were fatally injured.The investigation found that the right-wing fuel tank was empty. There was no evidence of pre- or postimpact fuel leakage. The backing plate behind the fuel selectors was bent during the impact, and had jammed the left selector in its selected position. It appeared that the pilot may have been cross feeding fuel from the left-wing tank to feed the right engine.The aircraft had been reweighed 5 months prior to the accident. The operator had not sought to obtain CASA approval of the new weight and balance data sheet for inclusion in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). There was no evidence that the pilot had computed load distribution within the aircraft. The investigation determined that while the aircraft was within the weight limitations, the load distribution placed it in a significantly aft centre of gravity (c of g) situation for takeoff and landing. The investigation determined that the right engine had failed, probably subsequent to the SARWATCH broadcast, but sufficiently before the aircraft pitched nose up, in order for the pilot to have had time to wind in full nose-left rudder trim to counteract the aerodynamic forces imposed by the failure of the right engine."
278,ACC2091,"The aircraft, a Conair Aviation Convair CV-580 (turboprop conversion 340-32) engaged in fire suppression activities, experienced a loss of directional control and subsequent runway excursion upon landing at Manning Airport (CFX4), Manning, Alberta. The airplane sustained substantial damage and the two pilots onboard received minor injuries.The aircraft was in the descent for landing on runway 25 when one of the pilots became incapacitated. As the other pilot took control of the aircraft and performed the landing, directional control was lost on the rollout. The aircraft departed the right side of the runway and travelled across a ditch, approximately 3000 feet from the threshold. The nose gear collapsed and the fuselage broke into 2 sections.

The pilot, flight instructor, and two passengers were uninjured. The airplane was operated as an instructional flight that was not operating on a flight plan.Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that last departed from Jonesboro Municipal Airport, Arkansas at 16:50 and was destined to DXE.The pilot stated that the purpose of the flight was a Beechcraft B100 initial training flight with a second pilot who occupied the right pilot seat. According to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the flight instructor was in a non-seated position between both pilots.The left seat pilot stated that they flew about 3 hours and had taken turns performing turns, stalls, slow flight and approaches. He stated that the accident landing was the third landing of the day that he performed. He said that during the left downwind approach for landing on runway 18, he performed the airplane checklist items that the flight instructor read to him. The left seat pilot said that the landing gear extended, and the three landing gear position indicator lights illuminated green. The left seat pilot said that during touchdown, the right side of the airplane descended lower than the left side and then the right main landing gear collapsed. The airplane veered off and into a grass area adjacent to the runway.The aircraft came to rest approximately 2,518 feet from runway 18 touchdown end and 100 feet west of the runway edge in a field of grass. The right hand main gear was collapsed, right hand prop blades were bent and the right wing leading edge and tip was damaged. Evidence of fuel leakage was noted surrounding the right wing in the grass. The wing top skin outboard of the engine nacelle displayed evidence of wrinkling.Post-accident examination revealed the bottom right wing skin to the integral fuel tank was torn resulting in an approximate five by three inch hole. The right main gear actuator assembly exhibited numerous bent parts and was broken out of its mounting structure. The inboard top actuator mounting structure was torn away from the airframe. The right nacelle fuel tank bulkhead was ruptured with the top of the gear actuator resting inside the tank area. The top wing skin wrinkling was not as evident post recovery but still shows signs of damage. Puncture damage to the fuselage pressure vessel was noted in 5 places below the copilot side window and a two-inch crack or tear was found on the belly skin approximately centered between the main gear legs.The rigging for the landing gear system could not be checked nor could functional gear swing test be performed due to damage incurred to the system from the accident.The accident aircraft, N86TR, was involved in a gear-up landing incident On November 17, 2005 at Fulton County Airport, Atlanta."

The pilot suffered a minor injury, but none of the 17 skydivers on board were injured.The pilot reported that following takeoff from runway 26, he made a right turn and continued his climb for the skydive drop, however, while passing through 1,000 feet above ground level, the engine lost power. The pilot initiated a turn toward the airport, however, realized he was unable to make it, and landed in an open field. During the landing roll, the airplane exited the field, crossed E Jahant Road, impacted a truck, continued into a vineyard, and nosed over.Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the fuel pressure line that connects the fuel control unit to the airframe fuel pressure transducer was fractured below the fuel control unit fitting's swaged seat. In addition, a supporting clamp for the fuel pressure fuel line was fractured and separated. The operator reported that the fractured fuel line had been replaced the night before the accident and had accumulated about 4 hours of operational time. The previously-installed line had also fractured."

282,ACC2095,"An Antonov An-12B cargo plane, operated by Silk Way Airlines, overran the runway during takeoff from Dwyer Airport, Afghanistan, and burst into flames. Seven of the nine occupants suffered fatal injuries.The crew planned to fly from Baku (Azerbaijan) to Bagram (Afghanistan), Dwyer (Afghanistan), Mary (Turkmenistan) and then back to Baku. The flight legs to Dwyer Airport were uneventful. At 13:11 the crew started the engines on the apron at Dwyer Airport. Engine no.2 was the last to be started up at 13:47 hours.Before the takeoff the captain distributed the duties within the crew, nominating the first officer as the Pilot Flying, and himself as Pilot Monitoring.After the engine startup the crew initiated taxiing to perform takeoff on runway 23. The concrete runway at Dwyer measured 2439 m by 37 m. In the course of the takeoff preparations, at 13:57:56 the flight mechanic reported an increase in MGT of engine no.3 above the acceptable level: ""Engine 3, look, engine temperature over six hundred, over seven hundred"", which was confirmed by the first officer: ""Yes, its getting temperature"" while the captain asked to be more attentive.The takeoff was performed with Flaps 15. As the checklist was being read, the captain ordered to lock the propellers. After the captain's order to lock the propellers a slight increase in torque values was recorded on engine no.1 and 4, and in 17 seconds also engine no.2. There was no evidence that the propeller of engine no.3 was locked.At 13:59:42 the crew initiated the takeoff. Before the takeoff the ATC advised the crew on the wind direction and speed on the runway: 280° 14 knots (7 m/sec) gusting 26 knots (13 m/sec). Thus it was quartering headwind and the headwind component might have been 5 to 9 m/sec.While performing takeoff the crew first increased thrust on engines no.1 and no.4 and then on engine no.2 after 10 seconds. The thrust of the three engines was about 50 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (lower than takeoff mode). The third engine was still operating in the ground idle mode, though the CVR did not record any crew callouts concerning engine no.3 operation parameters.Based on the CCTV system of Dwyer Airport the takeoff roll was initiated almost from the runway threshold and was conducted to the left of the runway centerline. No significant deviations from the takeoff course during the takeoff roll were recorded. During the takeoff roll the rudder was deflected left close to extreme. Probably the pilots were also applying differential control on engine no.2 to decrease the right torque moment.At 14:00:14 at approximately 120 km/h IAS the ""Engine no.3 negative thrust"" signal started. At that time the aircraft was about 430 m away from the start of the takeoff roll.At 14:00:42 engines no.1 and no.4 thrust was increased up to 63 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (consistent with takeoff mode for the actual flight conditions). At that time the IAS was about 150 km/h. Engine no.2 thrust was increased up to the same value only 23 seconds later at about 200 km/h IAS. At that time the aircraft was about 840 m away from the runway end. Engine no.3 was still operating in ground idle mode. Approximately 260 m before the runway end at a speed of 220 km/h IAS (maximum speed reached) nose up input on the control column was started. The aircraft did not lift off. After rolling all along the runway the aircraft overran the runway onto the ground at a speed of 220 km/h.While moving on the ground the aircraft sustained significant damage, which led to a post-crash fire that destroyed most of the aircraft structures. Out of the nine persons on board seven were killed and two were seriously injured and taken to hospital."
283,ACC2096,"A Cessna 501, N804ST, lost cabin pressurization during cruise at flight level 430 and entered an uncontrolled descent near Texarkana, Arkansas. The pilot regained consciousness and control of the airplane about 7,000 feet mean sea level and landed without further incident. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings due to the excessive loads on the wings during the descent/recovery.  The pilot and two passengers sustained minor injuries and one passenger was uninjured.Night meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Post-accident examination of the airplane revealed that the primary pressurization duct into the cabin was separated from its connection to the water separator. The duct's metal retaining clamp was present with its retaining screw in place. The clamp was not fractured and was resting around the metal duct leading to the separator."
284,ACC2097,"During takeoff from Akobo Airstrip at approximately 10 a.m. Local Time, the pilot executed a premature takeoff due to animal incursion on the runway.

286,ACC2099,"Mahan Air flight 4525 suffered a runway excursion accident after landing at Khark Airport (KHK), Iran. The aircraft, a BAe-146-300 passenger jet operated a scheduled passenger flight from Ahwaz to Khark Airport. On board were two cockpit crew members , two augment cockpit crew, five cabin crew, one flight mechanic, and 79 passengers. The departure, en route and descent phases were uneventful. By the time of contacting Khark Island information, weather conditions were reported being CAVOK, wind 300° at 16 knots and flight 4525 has been directed to proceed for a right hand downwind approach to runway 31.When 10 NM out, the crew requested a wind check. Winds were reported from 300 degrees at 10 knots. Having in mind the tailwind limitation of 15 knots as stated in the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) and Operations Manual (OM), the captain judged that a tailwind of 10 knots made it possible to conduct an approach and landing on runway 13. The co-pilot then requested a visual approach to runway 13, which was approved.The cockpit crew then continued for runway 13, configured the aircraft for landing and completed the landing checklist with an approach speed (target speed) of 129 knots and VREF of 119 knots.At 300 feet MSL, first officer noticed airspeed had been accelerating to 145 knots and made a standard callout ""airspeed 145 knots"". Instead of performing a go-around, the captain called out ""Auto Brake Out"", and briefed his first officer about the first portion of go-around procedure.The aircraft crossed the threshold of runway 13 and landed at approximately 685 meters (2,247 feet) beyond the beginning of the runway 13. The available runway length at Khark Airport was 2334 meters.The aircraft failed decelerate sufficiently, in part due to a fault in the anti-skid system and overran onto rough ground. The nose landing gear collapsed and the aircraft came to rest about 54 m from the runway end."
287,ACC2100,"The Antonov 2 biplane was destroyed when it impacted terrain near Novopokrovskoye, Russia during an aerial application flight. Both occupants were killed.The aircraft was contracted to carry out agricultural operations starting at the end of April 2016. A captain, co-pilot and technician were assigned to the aircaft. On June 20, 2016 the co-pilot left the crew without explanation of the reasons. This posed a problem for the captain, as agricultural flights may only be carried by two pilots. In violation of this, the captain started carrying out flights on his own. On June 29, an acquaintance of the pilot and a former AN-2 pilot, flew along. On June 29 and June 30 eyewitnesses noticed that both men were consuming alcoholic beverages between flights.The accident happened on the fifth flight of the day.  The aircraft impacted terrain during a turn. A fire developed, which consumed the aircraft.It was established that turns were executed at bank angles of about 40°, which exceeded the allowed 30°. Furthermore, the flight was executed at altitudes of 20-40 m where the limit was 50 m."

A VFR circuit was executed to simulate a flapless landing. While in the circuit, the crew experienced an actual communication failure on COM 1 while two other aircraft were inbound to Iqaluit. At the end of the downwind leg, a flap failure was simulated and the crew carried out the appropriate checklist. However, the landing checklist was not completed and the aircraft landed with the landing gear in the up position on runway 16. The aircraft skidded on the belly and came to a stop on the runway between taxiway A and G. The crew declared an emergency and evacuated the airplane with no injuries. The aircraft sustained damage to the belly pod and both propellers."
291,ACC2104,"A Cessna 208B air drop configured airplane, N7581F, sustained substantial damage during a runway excursion after landing on runway 18 at the Baldwin Airport, Wisconsin. The commercial pilot and 14 passengers were not injured. No flight plan was filed and local traffic advisory was requested by the pilot. Visual meteorological conditions with light rain showers prevailed throughout the area. The flight originated from Baldwin Airport about 13:50.According to the pilot, he had ferried the airplane from Forest Lake, Wisconsin, to Baldwin on the morning of the accident. The airplane had just completed its 100-hour inspection at Forest Lake. After flying three air drops without incident, he prepared for his fourth flight of the day. He stated that all of the previous 3 flights had successfully deployed the parachutists and were full stop landings in an empty airplane. Due to the temperatures of 90+ degrees and high humidity, the pilot requested his manifests limit to 14 parachutists and allow a longer time between shutdowns to allow for adequate cooling before the next flight. The pilot reported that pop-up rain showers had been passing north and south of Baldwin throughout the morning, but never coming closer than 10-15 miles. While preparing for the fourth flight of the day (accident flight) the pilot discussed the weather with a experienced parachutist. Clouds were currently over the intended drop zone but there was no rain and the clouds were moving away from the northern edge of the drop zone. The pilot and parachutist agreed that it was worth attempting the drop considering the cloud movement away from the drop zone. The 14 parachutists were loaded and the airplane took off. Climbing through 3,000 feet MSL, the pilot checked in with ATC for traffic advisory and a radio check. Climbing through 4,000 feet, ATC advised the pilot that light to moderate precipitation was in the area. The pilot continued to climb toward the drop zone to see if there was any rain over the area and about 1-1.5 miles from the zone, light rain was encountered. The pilot advised the parachutists that they were returning to Baldwin to land because of the weather.After descending, the pilot set up a base leg to runway 18, and about two miles from the airport, turned on final. The approach was a stabilized, powered-on approach which was much flatter than the standard descent with an empty airplane. The pilot used flaps incrementally to 30-degrees (full flaps), initiated a flare over the threshold, and touched down at 65 knots. Full reverse propeller was used and the flaps retracted during the landing rollout. When the pilot started to apply brakes he discovered that the braking action was null. The 1,950 foot-long grass runway was wet because of a recent rain shower. Because of the high temperature, humidity, full load, and trees at the end of the runway, the pilot decided to not attempt a go around. The pilot held full aft on the control yoke for aerodynamic braking, stayed in full propeller reverse, and braked as much as possible without locking the wheels up. Just before coming to a complete stop (about 5-10 mph), the airplane rolled into a ditch before a road beyond the departure end of the runway. The propeller struck the dirt and the tail, causing substantial damage to the empennage. The pilot secured the engine and all of the occupants exited the airplane."

The aircraft was last detected on radar 151 nautical miles (280 km) east of Chennai, making a left turn with a rapid loss of height from 23,000 ft, according to the Defence Ministry.Underwater search efforts were terminated on October 3, 2016 due to rough weather as well as tethering problems with the ROV."
293,ACC2106,"Emirates Airlines flight EK521, a Boeing 777-300, impacted the runway during an attempted go-around at Dubai Airport (DXB), United Arab Emirates. All 300 on board survived the accident. One fire fighter was killed during the ARFF operations.The aircraft departed Thiruvananthapuram, India at 05:06 hours UTC. The captain was the pilot flying (PF), and the copilot was the pilot monitoring (PM).As the flight neared Dubai, the crew received the automatic terminal information service (ATIS) Information Zulu, which included a windshear warning for all runways.The aircraft was configured for landing with the flaps set to 30, and approach speed selected of 152 knots (VREF + 5) indicated airspeed (IAS) The aircraft was vectored for an area navigation (RNAV/GNSS) approach to runway 12L. Air traffic control cleared the flight to land, with the wind reported to be from 340 degrees at 11 knots, and to vacate the runway via taxiway Mike 9.During the approach, at 08:36:00 UTC (12:36 local time), with the autothrottle system in SPEED mode, as the aircraft descended through a radio altitude (RA) of 1,100 feet, at 152 knots IAS, the wind direction started to change from a headwind component of 8 knots to a tailwind component.The autopilot was disengaged at approximately 920 feet RA and the approach continued with the autothrottle connected. As the aircraft descended through 700 feet RA at 08:36:22, and at 154 knots IAS, it was subjected to a tailwind component which gradually increased to a maximum of 16 knots.At 08:37:07, 159 knots IAS, 35 feet RA, the PF started to flare the aircraft. The autothrottle mode transitioned to IDLE and both thrust levers were moving towards the idle position. At 08:37:12, 160 knots IAS, and 5 feet RA, five seconds before touchdown, the wind direction again started to change to a headwind.The right main landing gear touched down at 08:37:17, approximately 1,100 meters from the runway 12L threshold at 162 knots IAS, followed three seconds later by the left main landing gear. The nose landing gear remained in the air.At 08:37:19, the aircraft runway awareness advisory system (RAAS) aural message ""LONG LANDING, LONG LANDING"" was annunciated.At 08:37:23, the aircraft became airborne in an attempt to go-around and was subjected to a headwind component until impact. At 08:37:27, the flap lever was moved to the 20 position. Two seconds later the landing gear lever was selected to the UP position. Subsequently, the landing gear unlocked and began to retract.At 08:37:28, the air traffic control tower issued a clearance to continue straight ahead and climb to 4,000 feet. The clearance was read back correctly.The aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 85 feet RA at 134 knots IAS, with the landing gear in transit to the retracted position. The aircraft then began to sink back onto the runway. Both crewmembers recalled seeing the IAS decreasing and the copilot called out ""Check speed."" At 08:37:35, three seconds before impact with the runway, both thrust levers were moved from the idle position to full forward. The autothrottle transitioned from IDLE to THRUST mode. Approximately one second later, a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) aural warning of ""DONT SINK, DONT SINK"" was annunciated.One second before impact, both engines started to respond to the thrust lever movement showing an increase in related parameters.At 08:37:38, the aircraft aft fuselage impacted the runway abeam the November 7 intersection at 125 knots, with a nose-up pitch angle of 9.5 degrees, and at a rate of descent of 900 feet per minute. This was followed by the impact of the engines on the runway. The three landing gears were still in transit to the retracted position. As the aircraft slid along the runway, the No.2 engine-pylon assembly separated from the right hand (RH) wing. From a runway camera recording, an intense fuel fed fire was observed to start in the area of the damaged No.2 engine-pylon wing attachment area. The aircraft continued to slide along the runway on the lower fuselage, the outboard RH wing, and the No.1 engine. An incipient fire started on the underside of the No.1 engine.The aircraft came to rest adjacent to the Mike 13 taxiway at a magnetic heading of approximately 240 degrees. After the aircraft came to rest, fire was emanating from the No. 2 engine, the damaged RH engine-pylon wing attachment area and from under the aircraft fuselage. Approximately one minute after, the captain transmitted a ""MAYDAY"" call and informed air traffic control that the aircraft was being evacuated.Together with the fire captain, the first vehicle of the airport rescue and firefighting service (ARFFS) arrived at the Accident site within one minute of the aircraft coming to rest and immediately started to apply foam. Additional firefighting vehicles arrived shortly after. Apart from the captain and the senior cabin crewmember, who both jumped from the L1 door onto the detached slide, crewmembers and passengers evacuated the aircraft using the escape slides, though not all exits could be used as some slides were blown up against the aircraft. The slide at the L1 door deflated after several passengers had evacuated.Twenty-one passengers, one flight crewmember, and one cabin crewmember sustained minor injuries, and a second cabin crewmember sustained a serious injury.Approximately nine minutes after the aircraft came to rest, a firefighter was fatally injured as a result of the explosion of the center fuel tank."

A safe diversion was carried out.The airplane departed New Orleans International Airport, Louisiana at 09:10 hours local time for a flight to Orlando International Airport, Florida. While climbing through FL310, about 26 km south off Biloxi, the air inlet cowl of the nr.1 engine broke away. The flight contacted Houston Center about 09:22, stating: ""engine failure...we've lost number one engine, we're descending"". Initially the flight was cleared down to FL260. The flight then radioed ""472 we need get down below ten"". The flight was then cleared down to FL240 and the flight again stated that they needed to get down to 10000 feet.While descending the crew made two unintentional transmissions to Houston Center in which they can be heard working the related emergency checklist with a sound indicating the possible use of oxygen masks by the crew.The flight then diverted to Pensacola were it landed about 09:40. After landing damage was observed to the left hand wing root, a 5-inch by 16-inch hole in the fuselage and dents in the left hand horizontal stabilizer leading edge.The NTSB on September 12 reported the following initial findings from the engine examination include:- One fan blade separated from the fan disk during the accident flight and - The root of the separated fan blade remained in the fan hub; however, the remainder of the blade was not recovered.- The fracture surface of the missing blade showed curving crack arrest lines consistent with fatigue crack growth. The fatigue crack region was 1.14-inches long and 0.217-inch deep, - The center of the fatigue origin area was about 2.1 inches aft of the forward face of the blade root. No surface or material anomalies were noted during an examination of the fatigue crack origin using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy."

299,ACC2112,"A	Reims F406 Caravan II aircraft (OH-OTL), departed for	a	routine cargo flight from Rovaniemi Airport to Oulu.The aircraft had	a	two-pilot crew and carried 347 kg of mail. There were no other persons on board besides the crew.Flight preparation, aircraft loading and taxiing from the stand to take-off position were uneventful.Taxiing distance was about 800 m. The aircraft took off on runway 03 at 19:30	LT. The weather was good and it was starting to become dark at that time in the evening. When the landing gear was retracted, the GEAR UNLOCKED warning light and the HYD PRESS ON indicator for the hydraulic system remained on. At the pilot-in-command's request, the co-pilot selected gear back down, and the three green lights indicating that the gear was down and locked illuminated normally. The HYD PRESS ON indicator and GEAR UNLOCKED warning were also extinguished as usual.The pilot-in-command continued flying towards Oulu, and the co-pilot searched the emergency checklists for suitable procedures for the situation. Any procedures directly applicable to this malfunction were not found, but the pilots decided to follow the procedure for cases where the HYD PRESS ON light remained on continuously. The procedure assisted in isolating the fault to the landing gear system, but the exact nature of the malfunction was not clear. The pilots took the actions as instructed, except that the point ""landing gear switch	-	rapidly recycle"" was omitted, since the gear was already extended and the indicator lights showed that it was down and locked.The pilot-in-command decided to continue to Oulu with the gear down, as the procedure did not call for landing as soon as possible and the weather was good. Approach and landing at Oulu were performed in darkness at 20:05. The aircraft touched down at the beginning of the runway, and the landing run was normal at first. When the plane had decelerated to	a	speed of about 60 kt,	the pilot-in-command started braking, at which time the right main landing gear collapsed and the aircraft tilted to the right. The pilot-in-command stated that he had managed to keep the plane on the runway using nose wheel steering, braking hard on the left side and applying reverse thrust in the left engine. The aircraft stopped quickly after the landing gear had collapsed, within	a	distance of about 80 m.The aircraft came to	a	stop on the right edge of runway 30, remaining well on the paved surface. The engines were running until the plane stopped and were then shut down. The pilot in-command asked the co-pilot to report the incident to the ATC and request	a	tow vehicle.After sending the report, electrical power was switched off. ATC alerted the rescue services, and the pilots exited the plane uninjured."
300,ACC2113,"The aircraft had taken off from East Midlands Airport, United Kingdom carrying 16 tonnes of cargo. Destination was Belfast International Airport, Northern Ireland.As the aircraft descended through 1,000 ft in preparation for landing on runway 25 at Belfast International Airport, it was configured with flaps 30, and autopilot and auto throttle were disengaged. The calibrated airspeed was about 148 kt (VREF + 7), with a tailwind component of approximately 5 kt and crosswind component of approximately 10 kt from the left.As the aircraft descended below 500 ft, the descent rate was a nominal 800 fpm. This was maintained until about 40 ft agl when the landing flare was initiated, reducing to about 600 fpm (10 fps) at touchdown. The aircraft touched down with 1.7° of left bank and a drift angle of 3° to the right, at about 148 kt CAS (VREF + 7) and a peak recorded normal acceleration of 1.65 g.The aircraft touched down about 250 m beyond the threshold of runway 25. The speedbrakes were deployed, and subsequently the thrust reversers and the brakes were selected. The crew felt a vibration that started to increase in intensity and they suspected a tyre failure. The anti-skid fail warning illuminated, and the crew cancelled the thrust reversers and automatic braking as  sufficient runway remained in which to stop. The aircraft track continued to oscillate close to the runway centreline before stopping 2,170 m beyond the threshold of runway 25 at its intersection with runway 17/35. There were no injuries and the aircraft was moved from the runway at approximately 19:00 hrs.The physical and recorded evidence indicate that the fracture to the lower torsion link on the right main landing gear leg was most likely caused by shimmy. This and previous occurrences show that the Boeing 737 main landing gear is susceptible to shimmy, particularly at higher landing speeds and for softer landings.The manufacturer has a mature and well-documented list of probable causal factors for shimmy on this aircraft type. There was no evidence of a pre-existing defect in the failed torsion link or the apex joint which would have caused the shimmy. It was not possible to assess the condition of the shimmy damper or determine if there was any freeplay in the joints associated with the torsion links. Accordingly it is possible that there was a failure of the damper or excessive freeplay in the joints, which combined with the high-speed landing may have induced shimmy."

That evening the flight was to fly back to Springbank with the pilot and 3 passengers.The pilot filed an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan via the MENBO and IGVEP waypoints to Calgary/Springbank, and the flight was expected to take 46 minutes at a cruise altitude of FL250.At 21:26, the pilot obtained an IFR clearance from the ground controller for the KELOWNA SEVEN DEP standard instrument departure (SID) procedure for runway 34.The instructions for the Runway 34 KELOWNA SEVEN DEP SID were to climb to 9000 feet ASL, or to an altitude assigned by air traffic control (ATC), and to contact the Vancouver Area Control Centre (ACC) after passing through 4000 feet ASL. The aircraft was then to climb and track 330° magnetic (M) inbound to the Kelowna non-directional beacon (LW). From LW, the aircraft was to climb and track 330°M outbound for vectors to the filed or assigned route.At 21:31, the Kelowna tower controller cleared the aircraft to take off from the intersection of runway 34 and taxiway D. The pilot acknowledged the clearance and began the take-off roll on runway 34 about 1 minute later. Radar data showed that, at 21:33:41, the aircraft was 0.5 nautical miles (nm) beyond the departure end of the runway and was climbing at more than 4000 feet per minute (fpm) through 2800 feet ASL, at a climb angle of approximately 16°. In that time, it had deviated laterally by about 3° to the right of the 330°M track associated with the SID.At 21:34:01, when the aircraft was 1.2 nm beyond the runway, it had climbed through 3800 feet ASL and deviated further to the right of the intended routing. The aircraft's rate of climb decreased to about 1600 fpm, and its ground speed was 150 knots. A short time later, the aircraft's rate of climb decreased to 600 fpm, its climb angle decreased to 2°, and its ground speed had increased to 160 knots.At 21:34:22, the aircraft was 2.1 nm beyond the departure end of the runway, and it was climbing through approximately 4800 feet ASL. The aircraft had deviated about 13° to the right of the intended track, and its rate of climb reached its maximum value of approximately 6000 fpm, with a climb angle of about 22°. The ground speed was roughly 145 knots.At 21:34:39, the aircraft was 2.7 nm beyond the departure end of the runway, passing through 5800 feet ASL, and had deviated about 20° to the right of the intended routing. The rate of climb was approximately 2000 fpm, with a climb angle of about 7°.According to the SID, the pilot was to make initial contact with the ACC after the aircraft had passed through 4000 feet ASL. Initial contact was made when the aircraft was passing through 6000 feet ASL, at 21:34:42.ACC acknowledged the communication and indicated that the aircraft had been identified on radar. The aircraft was then cleared for a right turn direct to the MENBO waypoint once it was at a safe altitude, or once it was climbing through 8000 feet ASL. The aircraft was also cleared to follow the flight-planned route and climb to 10 000 feet ASL.At 21:34:55, the pilot read back the clearance as the aircraft climbed through 6400 feet ASL, with a rate of climb of approximately 2400 fpm. The aircraft was tracking about 348°M at a groundspeed of about 170 knots.At 21:35:34, the aircraft began a turn to the right, which was consistent with the instruction from the ACC. Flying directly to the MENBO waypoint required the aircraft to be on a heading of 066°M, requiring a right turn of about 50°. At this point, the aircraft was still climbing and was passing through 8300 feet ASL. The rate of climb was about 3000 fpm.The aircraft continued the right turn and was tracking through 085°M. After reaching a peak altitude of approximately 8600 feet ASL, the aircraft entered a steep descending turn to the right, consistent with the characteristics of a spiral dive.At 21:35:47, the ACC controller cleared C-GTNG to climb to FL 250. The lack of radar returns and radio communications from the aircraft prompted the controller to initiate search activities.At 21:51, NAV CANADA notified first responders, who located the accident site in forested terrain at about midnight. The aircraft had been destroyed, and all of the occupants had been fatally injured.Because there were no flight recording systems on board the aircraft, the TSB could not determine the cause of the accident. The most plausible scenario is that the pilot, who was likely dealing with a high workload associated with flying the aircraft alone, experienced spatial disorientation and departed from controlled flight shortly after takeoff. The investigation also determined that the pilot did not have the recent night flying experience required by Transport Canada for carrying passengers at night."
304,ACC2117,"A Cessna 208, N208KM, was substantially damaged during a skydiving event over Marion County Airport (X35), Dunnellon, Florida. One of the 10 skydivers on board was fatally injured, and the commercial pilot and the other 9 skydivers were not injured. The airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by the National Parachute Test Center.The flight departed and climbed to an altitude of 1,250 ft above ground level. The first three skydivers exited the airplane uneventfully, and the fourth moved into position. The training advisor observed that the fourth skydiver seemed to hesitate, and the jumpmaster leaned forward toward him. As the fourth jumper exited the airplane, the training advisor noticed a flash of white and watched as the jumpmaster's reserve parachute deployed and entered the airplane's slipstream. The jumpmaster attempted to pull the parachute back into the airplane and was pulled into the door frame before being dragged out of the airplane. Observers on the ground watched as the jumpmaster descended beneath his streaming (unopened) reserve parachute to the ground. The ground observers reported that the jumpmaster made no movements, appeared to be unconscious, and did not deploy his main parachute. The pilot reported that he was able to maintain control of the airplane and land without further incident.Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the cargo door frame and fuselage were buckled."

306,ACC2119,"A Dornier 328Jet-310, operated by FlyMex, suffered a runway excursion accident after landing at Toluca Airport in Mexico.The aircraft departed Chetumal at 18:15 hours local time on a repositioning flight to Toluca with two flight crew and two cabin crew members on board. The first officer was Pilot Flying, captain was Pilot Monitoring. At 20:23 the flight contacted Toluca Tower and reported 14 nautical miles out. Runway 33 as in use for takeoffs and landings and at 20:25:37 hours, the Tower controller cleared FedEx flight FX54 for takeoff. FX54 was a McDonnell Douglas MD-10-30F (N311FE), bound for Memphis Airport, Tennessee, USA. At 20:26:37 hours, the Dornier 328 was cleared to land on the same runway. It was 5,5 nautical miles out at the time. Wind was reported by the controller as 40 degrees at 15 knots.The MD-10 became airborne at 20:26:59 hours and the Dornier touched down normally at 20:29:34 hours. As the nose landing gear was about to touch the runway, the aircraft began to deviate to the left. The captain took over control but was unable to regain control of the aircraft. It ran off the right side of the runway at a distance of 1270 m from the runway threshold and entered uneven terrain. The aircraft sustained substantial damage."
307,ACC2120,"A Federal Express McDonnell-Douglas MD-10 cargo plane, registration N370FE, suffered a collapse of the left main landing gear while landing on runway 10L at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, Florida.Flight FX910 originated from Memphis International Airport in Tennessee with a crew of two on board. Following the landing gear collapse, the no.1 engine pylon was severed and a significant fire erupted in that area. The aircraft came to rest on the edge of the runway, 1934 meters past the runway threshold of runway 10L. An explosion occurred some 75 seconds after the airplane came to a stop, blowing a wing panel in the air. The airport fire services arrived on scene about 1 minute and 45 seconds after the plane stopped. By then the left wing was fully engulfed in flames. The fire consumed the left hand wing, outboard of the no.1 engine."
308,ACC2121,"The Beech 200, N80RT, impacted terrain during a missed approach from runway 30 at Moorhead Municipal Airport (JKJ), Minnesota, USA. The pilot initiated a missed approach after losing visual reference of the runway environment during the final segment of a GPS instrument approach. The airplane impacted a field about 0.5 miles short of runway 30. The pilot and one passenger sustained minor injuries and five passengers were uninjured. The airplane received substantial damage.The aircraft departed from Baudette Airport at 17:14 hours local time and was on approach to Moorhead Municipal Airport's runway 30 at the time of the accident."
309,ACC2122,"A Beechcraft B200, registered VH-MVL, conducted a medical services flight from Innamincka, Australia to Moomba. On board the aircraft were the pilot and two passengers.On arrival at Moomba at about 12:50, the pilot configured the aircraft to join the circuit with flaps set to the approach setting and the propeller speed set at 1900 RPM. He positioned the aircraft at 150-160 kt airspeed to join the downwind leg of the circuit for runway 30, which is a right circuit. The pilot lowered the landing gear on the downwind circuit leg. He then reduced power to start the final descent on late downwind abeam the runway 30 threshold, in accordance with their standard operating procedures.At about the turn point for the base leg of the circuit, the pilot observed the left engine fire warning activate. The pilot held the aircraft in the right base turn, but paused before conducting the engine fire checklist immediate actions in consideration of the fact that they were only a few minutes from landing and there were no secondary indications of an engine fire. After a momentary pause, the pilot retarded the left engine condition lever to the fuel shut-off position, paused again to consider if there was any other evidence of fire, then closed the firewall shutoff valve, activated the fire extinguisher and doubled the right engine power.The pilot continued to fly the aircraft in a continuous turn for the base leg towards the final approach path, but noticed it was getting increasingly difficult to maintain the right turn. He checked the engine instruments and confirmed the left engine was shut down. He then adjusted the aileron and rudder trim to assist controlling the aircraft in the right turn. The aircraft became more difficult to control as the right turn and descent continued and the pilot focused on maintaining bank angle, airspeed (fluctuating 100-115 kt) and rate of descent.Due to the pilot's position in the left seat, he was initially unable to sight the runway when starting the right turn. The aircraft had flown through the extended runway centreline when the pilot sighted the runway to the right of the aircraft. The aircraft was low on the approach and the pilot realised that a sand dune between the aircraft and the runway was a potential obstacle. He increased the right engine power to climb power (2,230 foot-pounds torque) raised the landing gear and retracted the flap to reduce the rate of descent. The aircraft cleared the sand dune and the pilot lowered the landing gear and continued the approach to the runway from a position to the left of the runway centreline.The aircraft landed in the sand to the left of the runway threshold and after a short ground roll spun to the left and came to rest. There were no injuries and the aircraft was substantially damaged."
310,ACC2123,"Following a day of routine flying operations on 13 December, the DHC-8-400 aircraft night-stopped at Manchester Airport, U.K. and was parked on a remote stand. The operator's contracted maintenance organisation completed a routine daily check on the aircraft that evening. This included checking the oil content of the No 1 engine, accessed by opening the outboard main access panel on the engine nacelle. The check was concluded by approximately 21:15 hrs, with the aircraft scheduled to return to service for a 06:10 hrs departure the next morning. The aircraft Technical Log entry for the daily check was signed by the engineer at 00:10 hrs. The operating flight crew arrived at the aircraft at 05:30 hrs and began their normal pre-flight checks. At 05:50 hrs, in accordance with company procedures for the first flight of the day, the commander conducted the pre-departure inspection. As it was still dark, he used a torch to supplement the ambient airport lighting during his inspection. He did not identify any issues with the aircraft and the crew continued with their normal departure routine.The ground crew, who were responsible for pushing the aircraft back off the stand, subsequently arrived and conducted their own walkaround check of the aircraft, also identifying nothing of note. The aircraft was dispatched on time and taxied to runway 23R for takeoff.At approximately 06:24 hrs the aircraft commenced its takeoff roll and then continued on an apparently uneventful flight to Hannover, Germany, landing there at 07:52 hrs. After the aircraft had parked on the stand and the passengers had disembarked, the ground crew informed the cabin crew that a panel was missing from the No 1 engine. The message was relayed to the flight crew, who inspected the aircraft prior to contacting the operator's maintenance control department. The operator informed Manchester Airport operations staff at 08:36 hrs, who then conducted an inspection of runway 23R. The panel was recovered from a grass area to the side of the runway, approximately 440 m from the runway threshold.Sections of the panel hold-open strut were also recovered from the runway and adjacent paved areas in the same vicinity."

The aircraft stopped near the end of runway 23.At 13:50 local time the hijackers began releasing passengers. At the end of the afternoon both hijackers surrendered.The hijackers reportedly tried to draw attention to a new Libyan political party in favor of the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.In December 2020, one of the hijackers was sentenced to a jail time of 25 years."
314,ACC2127,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan sustained damage in an accident near Fort McMurray Airport, Alberta, Canada.The aircraft was on a VFR flight from Camrose to Fort McMurray, Canada . During the descent through 3 000 feet ASL, approximately 6 nautical miles South of Fort McMurray, the RESERVOIR FUEL LOW warning light illuminated. The pilot completed the checklist for this emergency and informed ATC that the aircraft had an engine issue, however without declaring an emergency. The pilot continued to join the base leg for runway 25 at Fort McMurray Airport. During the turn from base leg to final approach, the engine lost power approximately 1 nautical mile from the runway. The pilot determined that the aircraft would not make the runway and elected to land on a service road east of the airport. The aircraft landed in a field off airport property, approximately 1400 feet South West of the threshold of runway 25. The pilot and the three passengers exited the aircraft with no injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage, however there was no post-crash fire."
315,ACC2128,"A Hawker 800XP, N910JD sustained substantial damage when the nose landing gear collapsed during a landing roll at Scottsdale Airport (SDL), Arizona. The two pilots were not injured. The airplane was registered to Zoom Aviation, LLC, and operated by Pinnacle Air Charter, LLC. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument rules flight plan. The flight originated from Tucson International Airport, Arizona at 15:32.The pilot reported that, during the approach to Scottsdale, the nose landing gear light was red, which indicated that it was not down and locked. In order to assess the situation, the pilot exited the traffic pattern, and referred to the emergency checklist. After using the hand pump to lower the landing gear manually, the red light still indicated that the gear was up. The pilot asked the tower for a landing gear check and the tower replied that it appeared it was down and straight. The pilot executed a normal landing, and as the airplane started to slow down, about 35-40 knots, the nose gear collapsed. The airplane came to rest about 50 yards down the runway from the location where the nosegear collapsed."
316,ACC2129,"A Grumman G-73 Mallard amphibian was destroyed when it impacted the water of Swan River in Perth, Australia. The pilot and his passenger suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft was flying a display during the City of Perth Australia Day Skyworks 2017 event. It departed Serpentine Airport at 16:28 and proceeded along the coast towards Perth. A holding pattern was flown to the east of Garden Island at an altitude of approximately 1600 feet, waiting to fly a display. At 16:50 it continued flying north towards Perth in company with a Cessna Caravan amphibian.Both aircraft conducted a series of circuits that included low-level fly-pasts of the Langley Park foreshore. After the second fly-past, the pilot of VH-CQA commenced a third circuit, while the Caravan departed the area.As part of the third circuit, the pilot of the Mallard flew in an easterly direction, parallel with the South Perth foreshore, before commencing a left turn. This would have facilitated a third pass in a westerly direction along the Langley Park foreshore. During the left turn, the aircraft rolled left and pitched nose down, consistent with an aerodynamic stall. The aircraft collided with the water and broke up. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured."
317,ACC2130,"A Beech 200T, N60RA, was substantially damaged during landing at Palm Beach International Airport (PBI), West Palm Beach, Florida, USA. The tow pilots were not injured. The airplane was registered to a private corporation and operated by Eastern Air Express. The pilot reported that the preflight and enroute portions of the flight were uneventful. The flight was established on the localizer for the approach to runway 28R, which was dry. Flaps were set to the approach position and the landing gear were extended and showed ""3 green."" After touchdown, he heard noises, and the airplane started to sink. After the airplane came to a stop on the right side of the runway, the pilots noticed that the gear handle was up. The pilot stated, ""How did the gear handle get up?"" He then placed the handle to the down position. An inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration responded to the accident site and examined the airplane. Structural damage to the fuselage was confirmed. All three landing gear were found in a partially extended position. Skid marks from all three tires were observed on the runway, leading up the main wreckage. Both propeller assemblies were damaged due to contact with the runway. The pressure vessel was compromised from contact with a propeller blade. The nose landing gear actuator was forced up, into the nose gear well and penetrated the upper nose skin. Examination of the landing gear components did not reveal evidence of a pre-existing mechanical malfunction or malfunction."

The aircraft came to rest on the right side of the runway. The nose landing gear had collapsed and the right hand wing tip was bent.Kalaupapa Airport is an uncontrolled (nontowered) airport with a single runway and no taxiways. The pilots use a common frequency to state their intentions. The pilot of the Grand Caravan reported that she was going to establish an approach and landing to runway 05. While on a seven-mile final, she communicated with the pilot of an airplane that was on short final for the same airport. The pilot that was on short final reported that he would report when he was clear of the runway, and he did. The commuter pilot acknowledged the other pilot's clear of runway transmission, and initiated the approach. As the pilot descended through 150 feet above ground level, she noticed that the airplane that she had communicated with was not clear of the runway. The airplane on the ground was near the runway 23 numbers with the propeller turning, facing toward her landing airplane. She aborted the landing but the airplane did not climb. The airplane impacted the runway hard and bounced. She reported that when the airplane touched down after the bounce, she ""applied left rudder pedal to steer the aircraft off the runway and out of the way of the other aircraft's possible flight path."" The airplane exited the left side of the runway and ground-looped to the left. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right side of the fuselage and the right wing. After the ground-loop, the pilot of the airplane near the runway 23 numbers attempted to takeoff.

326,ACC2139,"Jet2 flight 	271, a Boeing 757-200, suffered a tail strike accident on landing at Alicante Airport in Spain.The aircraft originated from Leeds/Bradford Airport, U.K. at 08:13 UTC (09:13 LT). The crew consisted of the line supervising captain, the copilot and a line training captain, sitting in the observation seat, to evaluate the copilot for his completion of line training.The copilot was the aircraft's pilot flying (PF) during the whole route. The flight went smoothly and the crew carried out the final ILS Z approach manoeuvre for runway 10 at the Alicante-Elche Airport maintaining stabilized approach parameters as described in the operator's manual. Nine seconds after starting the landing flare manoeuvre, touchdown was made with a pitch attitude of 5°, a calibrated speed of 119 kt and a vertical descent speed of 240 fpm. There was a vertical acceleration of 1.45 G corresponding to a firm impact. The flare manoeuvre was considered slow, which the manufacturer identifies as a risk factor for tail strike.The position of the control column was slackened slightly after touchdown was made, but the pitch attitude tendency continued to increase until it reached a value of 10.2°, reaching a 1.14 G vertical acceleration value. This attitude was maintained for one second, causing the rear of the aircraft to strike the runway surface.After the tail area had struck the runway, the captain took control of the aircraft and continued the landing manoeuvre, completing it without any additional problems.The flight crew were unaware that the aircraft's tail area had touched the runway until they were informed at the parking area by one of the cabin crew that they had heard an unusual noise when landing. The aircraft suffered damage to the lower part of the tail cone. All the people on board disembarked normally without any medical attention being required."
327,ACC2140,"The BN-2A-26 Islander aircraft departed from Air Services Limited's company base at the Eugene F. Correia International Airport for Mahdia Airstrip. The aircraft was programmed to do a series of shuttles to various airstrips in the Region 8 area. The accident flight was the second shuttle between Mahdia and Kopinang. The previous flight was normal.For the second shuttle, the aircraft was loaded with one passenger and cargo for a flight to Kopinang Airstrip. The aircraft departed Mahdia at 11:12 hrs local time with an estimated flying time of 24 minutes. As the aircraft approached Kopinang, rain was observed over the airstrip. This caused the pilot to hold for about 10-15 minutes East of the field to allow the rain to pass.The aircraft landed, but during the landing roll the wheels locked up. The brakes were modulated, and the flaps were raised but the aircraft did not stop. The pilot then moved the mixture controls to shutoff and steered the aircraft left towards a playfield. This was occupied and he turned the aircraft right, into a construction site that was located off the end of the usable portion of the runway. The aircraft stopped in the construction area.The right hand main landing gear broke off and the nose landing gear was bent."
328,ACC2141,"The Cessna 208 aircraft registered PK-FSO, was being operated on an unscheduled cargo flight from Tanahmerah Airport to Oksibil Airport in Papua, Indonesia. On board the aircraft was one pilot, 1,225 kg of general cargo and 800 lbs of fuel.At 11:44 hours local time, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed Tanahmerah and cruised at altitude of 7,000 feet. Estimate time arrival at Oksibil would be 12:24.At 12:12, when the aircraft position was about 45 NM north of Tanahmerah, the aircraft passed another Cessna 208B aircraft from the opposite direction from Oksibil to Tanahmerah. The Cessna 208B pilot advised to the pilot via radio that the PK-FSO aircraft was in sight. The pilot responded that the aircraft was maintaining 7,000 feet on direct route to Oksibil.The pilot failed to contact the Oksibil air traffic controller and failed to arrive at the destination. The airline's flight following officer received an emergency signal with a last recorded position of 6 NM north of Oksibil. The next day the aircraft was found on a ridge of Anem Mountain at a height of 7100 feet. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and the pilot was fatally injured.The investigation learned that two days prior the occurrence, the pilot travelled on a night commercial flight. This might have resulted in a sleep disturbance during the window of circadian low and an increase of the potential of fatigue. There are indications that the pilot did not have the required adequate restorative sleep before he started flying on the accident day. Prior to the occurrence flight, the pilot had flown for 3 flight sectors, with total flight hour of 2 hours 55 minutes. The multiple take-offs and landings that day increased fatigue. Based on the final flight track, the absence of voice communication, the weather condition permitting the pilot to identify the airport location and the aircraft wreckage, consistently indicated that there were no pilot activities to fly the aircraft after the last known pilot activities at about 29 Nm from Oksibil until impact.Colleagues of the pilot reported that he often smoked in the cockpit during the flight, looked sleepy and engaged the Terrain Inhibit switch which disabled the GA-EGPWS function while flying. This prevented any prior warning when the aircraft neared Anem Mountain.This known behavior was not reported to the Operation and Safety department, so no action could be taken."

349,ACC2162,"A Lockheed P2V-5 airplane, N410NA, was substantially damaged shortly after departure from Pocatello Regional Airport (PIH), Idaho, USA. The two pilots and mechanic were not injured. The airplane flew under contract with the United States Forest Service. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not filed for the local flight. According to the pilot-in-command (PIC), the flight departed on its third mission to disperse fire retardant over a nearby wildfire. During the airplane's climb, the flight crew increased the airplane's nose up pitch by a few more degrees and the PIC subsequently responded with increasing nose down pressure. However, the down pressure control input required additional force, so the PIC used trim inputs to reduce the pressure. Moments later he observed an uncommanded aft movement of the control yoke with a simultaneous increase in the airplane's pitch attitude. He instructed the first officer (FO) to retract the flaps while he re-trimmed the elevator, but they were not able to regain pitch control. The FO attempted to adjust his trim wheel and then re-trim the airplane using the emergency varicam, but the airplane continued to maintain a pitch up attitude. He then deployed 5° of flaps at the PIC's instruction, which reduced the elevator backpressure. The PIC subsequently jettisoned the load of fire retardant over vacant farm land and then asked the FO to declare an emergency with the tower controller while the PIC entered a shallow left turn to intercept the downwind leg for runway 21. As he made his control inputs he determined that the elevator was bound, as he received little response from the elevator control. As the PIC had previously demonstrated the ability to land without making any adjustments to power or pitch in flight training, he elected to configure the airplane for an approach without trim or elevator control. The flight crew flew a wide traffic pattern and made small adjustments to compensate for altitude. During the final approach leg, the PIC used a combination of wing flaps and engine power for pitch up adjustments, and the crew coordinated application of elevator for trimmed pitch and turns to make their pitch down adjustments. As the airplane reached about 500 feet above ground level, the flight crew deployed the airplane's remaining 5° of flaps to increase the pitch attitude. Both the PIC and FO pulled hard on the yoke while the FO gently retarded the throttles and the PIC trimmed the emergency varicam. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed damage to the varicam. As this secondary control surface is directly connected to the elevators and provides a primary structural load path for all elevator loads, the damage was classified as substantial. Further examination of the varicam showed that one of the varicam actuator's outboard drive stop bolts had backed out of the drive coupling, and that the two bolts had not been safety wired. The airplane did not sustain any damage during the airplane's landing."
350,ACC2163,"The aircraft was being operated by a sport parachute club and was on the fifth sortie of the day dropping parachutists over Netheravon Airfield from heights up to 13,000 ft. Following a rapid descent, the aircraft was stabilised for the final approach to runway 22 with flap 30 set, airspeed 85 kt and propeller rpm set to max. The weather was good with a surface wind from 200° at 13 kt. The aircraft was stabilized but, on short finals at about 150 to 200 ft, the aircraft started to drop, which the pilot described as ""the sensation... of being rapidly pushed down"", or windshear. He tried to pull up to correct the descent but landed heavily in a flat, nose down attitude. The aircraft skidded along the grass runway, veering off to the right and coming to a halt alongside the runway. During the landing, the nose landing gear broke off and the propeller contacted the ground. When the aircraft stopped, the pilot isolated the fuel and electrical systems and vacated through the normal exit.An internal investigation identified that the aircraft had touched down in the undershoot and the nose landing gear had probably broken when it encountered a shallow drainage ditch."

The Boeing 767 was being marshalled onto gate 69B after arrival and was instructed to stop approximately 15 feet short of the stop line because it is normally a tow-in gate. The flight crew shut down the engines and awaited the ground crew to hook up the tow bar. There are white lines painted around each gate area to aid ground vehicles driving on the ramp. The B767 tail protruded beyond the white lines perpendicular to, and adjacent to, taxiway C. The Boeing 737 was taxiing out for departure via taxiway C in accordance with ATC instructions. The captain reported that he saw the B767 and maneuvered left of centerline for more clearance. However, the NTSB reports that surveillance video from Gate 69B showed that the B737 nosewheel was tracking along the yellow centerline of taxiway C.The captain asked the first officer (FO), who was heads down making FMS entries, to look and verify if they had enough clearance. The FO reported he saw that the B767 was hooked up to the tug but wasn't sure if it was being towed. He judged that there was about 5 feet of clearance. He said he saw no action by the marshallers indicating they thought the airplanes were too close.As the airplane continued taxiing, the right winglet of the B737 contacted the horizontal stabilizer of the B767. The flight crew reported that they did not feel an impact but were told by ATC that the collision had occurred. The B737 returned to the gate and deplaned passengers normally. The B767 was towed into the gate and deplaned passengers normally.C-GHOZ received substantial damage to its right hand elevator's lower right stabilizer control surface."

The pilot and eight passengers were not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. According to the pilot, after an uneventful landing on runway 3, he taxied the airplane from taxiway A2 to taxiway A and waited for further instructions from ground control at Sedona. A Fly-in & Car Show event was taking place at the time, and several areas on the ramp were occupied by the show. The pilot was then instructed by ground control to follow a truck on A6 taxiway to transient parking. The transient parking was moved to the east side of the ramp and was only accessible by taxiway A6 during the event. The pilot stated that as he followed the truck, he noticed several airplanes that were parked to the right side and their wings overhung into the taxiway near to the centerline. As he approached the airplanes he steered left of centerline to maintain clearance to his right. He had one ground personnel to the right side clearing the airplane's right wing and no one on the left side to clear the left wing. The pilot advanced the throttle after he was clear of the airplanes to his right and subsequently impacted a light pole with the left wing. The light pole was positioned about 65ft from the centerline of taxiway A6."

The flight between Mogadishu and Baidoa was uneventful. At 11:30 hours, the pilot took off from Baidoa with eight passengers onboard and landed safely at Xuddur at 12:03 hours.  At Xuddur, four passengers disembarked with their cargo and the pilot picked four other passengers with their cargo. As the pilot was preparing for take-off from Xuddur to Elberde there appeared to be some disagreements among the local agents about the cargo which was onboard the aircraft. The pilot was made to temporary suspend the take-off as the agents tried to sort out their differences. According to the pilot, there seemed to be unclear decision among the agents on whether to allow the pilot to proceed with the take-off or stop as the pilot was instructed to stop twice after being allowed to take off.A few moments later, the pilot decided to take-off after a group of Somali soldiers, local police, Ethiopian soldiers and the local agents had moved away from the aircraft. As soon as the pilot started taxing the aircraft for take-off two armed men came running brandishing guns towards the aircraft and started firing rapidly at the aircraft as the pilot continued with the take-off. The aircraft had gained some speed when the pilot decided to abort the take-off. As the pilot tried to abort the take-off the aircraft veered off the runway and collided with a building nearby before it stopped. All the occupants exited the aircraft using the rear door. The two front doors were inaccessible after the impact. Damage included a twisted propeller, a dent on the port wing, a shattered landing light, and two main landing tires deflated as a result of the bullet holes on both the tyres and the aircraft fuselage.

361,ACC2174,"The Jetstream 41 operated on a round trip between Hawarden and Bristol Airport, U.K. The flight departed Bristol at 08:00 UTC on the return leg to Hawarden. The captain was Pilot Flying.The descent checks and approach briefing for runway 22 had been completed and the aircraft was descending through FL150 to the south of Hawarden when the flight crew started to notice a burning smell. It appeared to them that the smell was coming from the air vents on the flight deck. They donned their oxygen masks and attempted to verify communication between themselves, but found it difficult because of high noise levels coming through the cockpit speakers.The co-pilot declared a MAYDAY to ATC, advising of a burning smell and their intention to continue to land at Hawarden. The commander contacted the cabin crew member on the interphone. She was hardly able to hear his message but understood that they were carrying out an emergency descent and went to check and secure the cabin. When he contacted her again she could not hear any of the message so she entered the flight deck. The commander gave her an emergency briefing, advising her that the aircraft would be landing in 10 minutes and to standby for instructions after landing. The noise levels through the cockpit speaker remained high and when the commander spoke or attempted a transmission there was a strong feedback signal.The approach and landing on runway 22 was completed and the commander taxied the aircraft clear of the runway, turning north onto adjacent taxiway D, and brought it to a stop. He did not know if he could contact the cabin crew member and was uncertain of the conditions in the passenger cabin, so he decided an emergency evacuation should be carried out. He shut down the engines and made a PA announcement to the cabin to initiate the emergency evacuation.After the commander made the evacuation announcement to the cabin, the engines continued to operate at idle power for 8 seconds before they started to run down; the propellers continued turning for a further 40 seconds. The forward cabin door and the two mid-cabin over wing emergency exits were opened by the passengers. The right over wing exit door was dropped to the ground behind the wing and blown forwards by the wind into the still rotating right propeller. The aft cabin exit door was opened by the cabin crew member; it fell to the ground and was blown rearwards by the propeller wash from the right engine.The passengers exited the aircraft and, once they had checked the cabin was clear, the crew followed. There was one minor injury. The burning smell was as a result of smoke and dust carried in the atmosphere from North Africa and Iberia.During 16 and 17 October the AAIB received 32 notifications of Smoke/Fume events affecting aircraft in UK airspace and the UK CAA received in excess of 60 reports. Of the 32 events reported to the AAIB, smoke/fumes were initially detected by flight and cabin crew members at altitudes from between 2,000 ft and FL200."

All fourteen occupants initially survived the accident, but a newborn baby died of injures in hospital.The aircraft departed Contamana at 11:28 hours local time, with destination Pucallpa. During the climb to 4500 feet, the pilots noticed that engine no. 2 began to lose power and immediately quit. They initially applied the restart procedures without succeeding. The crew then decided to return to Contamana which was 12 nautical miles (22 km) away. The pilot then connected the transfer valve of the fuel from the left tank to the right tank and managed to start engine no. 2. The pilot then decided to resume the flight to Pucallpa and continued with the climb to 13,500 feet. During the descent to Pucallpa, at 23 nautical miles (42 km) engine no. 2 began to lose power and shut down. Restart procedures were without success. A few minutes later, engine no. 1 also began to lose power and immediately shut down. The crew also tried to restart this engine, but again without success. With the two engines shut down, the flight declared an ""Emergency due to lack of fuel"" and the pilots decided to perform an emergency landing on the top of the trees."
363,ACC2176,"A Beech 200 aircraft operated by Transwest Air, was conducting medevac flight 911 from La Ronge, to Prince Albert, Canada with 7 persons on board. When the landing gear was selected down during the landing check at Prince Albert, the right main landing gear did not indicate down and locked. The flight crew interrupted the approach, climbed to the minimum sector altitude and circled over the airport while the emergency landing gear extension checklist was performed. However, the right main landing gear remained unsafe. The flight crew declared an emergency and consulted with the operators maintenance and flight operations. Following troubleshooting, the flight crew retracted the landing gear; however, the right main landing gear remained partially extended. The flight crew elected to land with the landing gear in the retracted position; consequently, the GEAR UP landing checklist was completed, passengers were briefed and ARFF was deployed for the landing on runway 26. While on shortfinal before the flare, both engines were shutdown and the propellers were feathered. After the aircraft stopped adjacent to taxiway A, the crew and passengers evacuated without injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the flaps and landing gear doors, and was later slung onto a flatbed trailer and transported to a hangar.Inspection by the operator's maintenance identified that the right main landing gear down lock latch had experienced a structural failure. Several segments of the down lock were found on the runway."

Two of passengers and the pilot received minor injuries.There was no fire."
365,ACC2178,"On 31 October 2017, a Perimeter Aviation Metro III, registration C-FLRY, was operating as flight 959 from Winnipeg-James Armstrong Richardson International Airport to Gods River Airport, Canada. After landing and selecting the speed levers low for taxi, the crew received a crew alerting system warning for the left engine oil pressure. The aircraft was then taxied to the ramp and a normal engine shutdown was performed.The pilot checked the oil level in the left engine and discovered it to be low. A maintenance crew was dispatched to Gods River to inspect and repair the oil pressure issue. After arriving, the maintenance crew added 3 quarts of oil and an inspection of the left engine revealed oil leaking from the engine oil pressure snubber. The aircraft was then parked overnight and arrangements were made to get the parts needed for the repair.The next day, on 1 November 2017, a new maintenance crew arrived with the required parts and replaced the left engine oil pressure snubber. Following a test run of the left engine, there was no evidence of an oil leak and maintenance released the aircraft back to service. During a pre-flight inspection, the aircraft maintenance engineer (AME) noticed a hydraulic fluid leak. The AME checked the hydraulic reservoir and found it to be low. An inspection of the hydraulic system did not reveal the source of the leak and the aircraft was once again parked overnight.On 2 November 2017, another maintenance and flight crew were sent to Gods River to address the hydraulic leak and fly the aircraft back to base. After a lengthy inspection and engine run, the maintenance crew could not identify the source of the hydraulic leak. It was determined that a ferry flight permit would be required to fly the aircraft to a company base at Thompson Airport, for further inspection and repair. The aircraft was then inspected and serviced to the degree necessary for the 50-minute flight. Hydraulic fluid was added to the reservoir, and 1 quart of oil was added to the left engine. The left engine and engine compartment were dry and did not show any signs of an oil leak. A ferry flight permit was then issued that stated the aircraft was to be flown with essential crew only and with the landing gear extended. The flight crew then contacted the assistant chief pilot for a pre-flight briefing that included the risk factors associated with the ferry flight and a discussion about potential emergencies and contingencies, including retracting the landing gear for emergency situations only.At approximately 18:30 on 2 November 2017, the aircraft, operating as Perimeter flight 959, departed Gods River on the ferry flight to Thompson Airport with only the 2 flight crew members on board. Approximately 15 minutes after departure, the crew noticed the left engine oil pressure drop into the yellow band range. The crew then consulted with maintenance operations control in flight and it was decided that if the oil pressure dropped below the yellow band and the oil temperature increased beyond the green band, then the engine was to be shut down.The crew began executing the Preplanned Engine Shutdown checklist in the quick reference handbook (QRH) so that they would be prepared if the left engine indications changed. The crew retracted the landing gear to reduce drag and received a gear up-and-locked indication. Because the oil temperature remained in the green band, the crew paused the checklist at the point where the generators are to be turned off, and continued flying the aircraft with the left engine running. When the aircraft was approximately 40 nautical miles southeast of Thompson Airport, the flight crew told air traffic control (ATC) that they had received a low oil pressure indication on the left engine and that the engine might need to be shut down. No emergency was declared, but aircraft rescue and firefighting services were put on standby.During the final approach to runway 24, the crew extended the landing gear. As the aircraft approached the runway threshold, the left engine rpm dropped to 96%. The pilot then adjusted the right engine rpm to counter the differential rpm. Although the left engine oil pressure dropped below the yellow band, the oil temperature indication did not rise and the crew elected to keep the engine running. It was reported that the left engine oil pressure dropped to 16 psi and the engine oil temperature indication never exceeded 88 °C.The aircraft's initial landing touchdown on runway 24 was on the right main gear, with both engines operating, approximately 1200 feet past the runway threshold. The captain pulled the power levers over the flight idle gate. An engine power surge was heard, and the aircraft began to pitch up and roll to the right. As the upset progressed, the right wing made contact with the runway and the aircraft pivoted around the right wingtip. The nose section then suddenly dropped to the ground and the aircraft came to rest off the runway, approximately 1800 feet past the runway threshold, in an upright position, facing the opposite direction with the engines still running. The engines were shut down using the engine stop and feather control, and the crew exited the aircraft via the left overwing emergency exit. There was no post-impact fire. The occurrence took place at 19:20, during the hours of darkness. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, propellers, landing gear, and right wing."
366,ACC2179,"An Antonov An-2 impacted wooded terrain next to a residence close to Ekimchan Airstrip, Russia. The aircraft was consumed by fire. One of the two pilots sustained fatal injuries.The aircraft had departed Ekimchan and was en route at an altitude of 1800 meters when the crew noticed a strong smell of gasoline in the cockpit. They decided to return to the departure aerodrome. During descent, the engine began running rough. Sparks and flames were observed. When approaching the airstrip at Ekimchan, the engine began losing power. At an altitude of about 50 meters, the engine stopped. Because of the presence of buildings in front of the aircraft, the crew executed the turn to the left. The aircraft impacted a wooded area, near the end of the runway."
367,ACC2180,"The crew reported for duty at Belfast City Airport at 05:50 hrs UTC to carry out a four-sector day flying to London City Airport and Inverness Airport. The first two sectors to London City and returning to Belfast City were flown without incident and with all the aircraft equipment and systems operating normally. Following a normal turnaround and flight preparation, the aircraft was refuelled and the passengers boarded. The weather was good with a surface wind of 260° at 12 kt, CAVOK with a temperature of +8°C and a dew point of +4°C. The aircraft was started and taxied for runway 22, from which it departed at 11:18 hrs. Shortly after takeoff, the landing gear selector lever was selected to the up position. On the Landing Gear Control and Indication Panel (LGCIP) the crew observed that the landing gear green lights extinguished, the three red lights and the amber landing gear door lights as well as the amber light in the landing gear selector lever all illuminated. After a short time, all three red lights extinguished, the left and right door lights extinguished but the nose door light and the light in the landing gear selector lever remained illuminated. The crew kept the airspeed below the 185 kt landing gear limit speed and climbed to 4,000 feet, routing to waypoint Magee to take up the hold whilst they assessed the problem. The aircraft entered the hold at 1132 hrs and the total fuel onboard was 2,800 kg. Whilst in the hold, the crew initially actioned the LANDING GEAR FAIL TO RETRACT abnormal checklist followed by the LANDING GEAR FAIL TO INDICATE LOCKED DOWN abnormal checklist. The MLG lowered and indicated locked down, but the NLG showed the unsafe indication with the amber nose door light still illuminated. The landing gear inoperative (ldg gear inop) caption also illuminated on the Caution and Warning Annunciator Panel. They actioned the ALTERNATE LANDING GEAR EXTENSION abnormal checklist and made several attempts to operate the nose landing gear alternate release handle but the indications remained the same. They reviewed the EMERGENCY LANDING - ONE OR BOTH ENGINES OPERATING abnormal checklist and decided to divert to Belfast International Airport. At this stage, the crew did not know if the NLG was up or down. The crew sought advice from their company and this confirmed their decision to go to Belfast International Airport. They reviewed the fuel and decided to leave the hold with 1,100 kg which would minimise the fuel onboard at touchdown but ensure sufficient fuel to carry out a go-around if required. The Senior Cabin Crew Member (SCCM) was called to the flight deck and the situation explained to her along with a briefing which included the procedure for an emergency evacuation, should it be required. Passengers seated adjacent to the propellers were moved to other seats away from the possible arc of any debris in case the propellers should contact the runway. Following this, the commander briefed the passengers on the problem and his intentions using the PA system. The cabin crew played the pre-recorded passenger emergency briefing and then walked through the cabin ensuring the passengers were all aware of what was required and that their restraint harnesses were secure. The passengers at the rear of the aircraft were warned of a possible increased drop to the ground from the rear doors due to the nose-down attitude if the NLG was not lowered. At Belfast International Airport, runway 25 was in use, the surface wind was 250° at 12 kt, visibility more than 10 km, clouds few at 1,800 feet and scattered at 2,900 feet, temperature +12°C, dew point +3°C, and the QNH 1020 hPa. The crew briefed for a radar vectored ILS approach for runway 25 with full landing flap and an approach speed of 110 kt. They also reviewed the emergency landing actions and reminded themselves where the CVR/FDR circuit breakers were located in order to ensure they were pulled after landing. The aircraft left the hold at 13:20 hrs with 1,100 kg of fuel as planned and commenced the approach. All the normal checks were carried out and at about 4 nm, ATC informed them that the nose landing gear had not extended. The approach was continued as briefed and at 200 ft, the co-pilot gave the BRACE command over the PA and all the passengers were seen to adopt this position. The aircraft touched down at 13:32 hrs on the main wheels and the nose was held off as the speed decayed and gently lowered onto the runway. As the aircraft came to a stop, both engines were shut down and when stopped, the commander ordered the evacuation."
368,ACC2181,"A Let L-410 aircraft operated by Khabarovsk Avia impacted a forest with little or no forward speed, 1200 m short of runway 04 at Nelkan Airport, Russia. Two crew members and four passengers suffered fatal injuries. A young girl was the only survivor. There was no fire.The aircraft operated on a domestic flight from Khabarovsk to Nikolayevsk-na-Amure and Nelkan. However, due to runway works at Nikolayevsk-na-Amure, it was decided to stop at Chumikan instead.At 12:35 the crew radioed the Nelkan Tower controller and received the approach and landing conditions and the landing site actual weather. The approach to landing was conducted to runway 04 with the standalone NDB using the right-hand landing pattern.The approach was conducted with flaps at 18° and the landing gear in the down position. After the crew started to perform the final approach, they reported the readiness for landing and received the respective clearance from the controller. The PIC acted as Pilot Flying. In the course of the final approach, at distance of about 5 km and at height of 400 m, the autopilot was disengaged, and the PIC having the runway in sight decided to continue the landing.After the autopilot disengagement, both Power Control Levers (PCLs) were set to the fine pitch mode; then the crew performed the landing checklist. The final approach was conducted within the speed range of 100 to 115 KIAS. The crew then set the PCLs to the fine pitch mode.The abnormal situation started to develop at 13:10:38 at height of approximately 170 m, when the speed was 108 kts. With the pedals' position remained unchanged and with zero roll, the magnetic heading was changed by 10° (to the right) within 5 seconds, then at 13:10:44 when both thrust control levers (TCLs) were set to forward thrust, the no.2 engine entered the BETA RANGE. A right roll started to develop, and after 4 to 5 s it reached about 20-25°. The crew tried to arrest the roll, but the aircraft began to descend and quickly lost speed.The crew's control actions aimed to recover the aircraft by applying the TCL of the no.1 engine, as well as the controls for the ailerons, elevators and rudder, failed. The crew did not feather the no.2 propeller and the no.2 engine continued to operate.At 13:10:53 at the height of 100 m, with a speed of 76 kts, the stall warning sounded. The aircraft started to develop an aggressive right roll and performed a full-circle rotation around its longitudinal axis (barrel-roll).The aircraft then impacted terrain.The investigation revealed that the no.2 engine propeller blades uncommanded turned to an angle of -1.8°, which was significantly below the minimum inflight pitch angle of 13.5°. During certification of the Let L-410 aircraft, the probability of a propeller uncommanded setting into the BETA range was considered to be 10-14."
369,ACC2182,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan crashed after striking a car after takeoff from Placencia Airport in Belize.The Tropic Air flight departed from the Belize City-Sir Barry Bowen Municipal Airport at approximately 07:15 local time. The flight was a regular operated commercial passenger flight with scheduled stops in Dangriga, Placencia and with the final destination being Punta Gorda. The pilot reported that the portion of the flight from Belize City to Dangriga was uneventful and normal and so was the landing at Placencia.At approximately 08:40 the airplane taxied from the Tropic Air ramp towards the west on runway 25. The pilot did a turnaround using all the available runway at normal speed and started his takeoff run to the east on runway 07. The pilot proceeded down the runway in a normal takeoff roll with normal takeoff speed and prior to reaching the end of the runway, he rotated the aircraft and lifted the nose wheel to get airborne. At exactly 28 feet past the end of runway 07 and during the initial climb phase, a part of the aircraft landing gear made contact with the upper part of the front right-hand passenger door frame of a Subaru Forester car that had breached the area in front of the runway which is normally protected by traffic barriers. The impact caused the aircraft to deviate from its initial climb profile, and the pilot reported that the engine was working for a couple seconds and it abruptly shut down shortly after. The pilot realized that he was unable to return to the airport.The pilot carried out emergency drills for engine loss after take-off over water and decided to ditch the aircraft in the sea, which was approximately 200-300 feet from the main shoreline in front of the Placencia Airport. The flight crew and all passengers were safely evacuated from the fuselage with the assistance of witnesses and passing boats which provided an impromptu rescue for the passengers. All passengers received only minor injuries.On board at the time of the accident were Acting Prime Minister Patrick Faber and Immigration Minister Godwin Hulse, who were on their way to the official launch of the PG Multipurpose Complex.The runway at Placencia has a length of about 620 meters. Plancencia Road runs around the eastern runway end. Warning signs say vehicles must stop and give way to aircraft landing and taking off."

At 17:59, northwest of Stuttgart, Langen Center instructed the flight to descend from FL210 to FL170, followed by a further descent instruction to FL150. At 18:03 the crew was instructed to change frequency to Swiss Radar. The controller of Swiss Radar instructed the crew to continue to descend to FL110. At 18:05 the crew contacted Zurich Arrival and were told to expect a runway 24 ILS approach to Friedrichshafen. Further descent instructions were given to FL90, 6000 feet, and 5000 feet. At 18:12 the flight was told to turn right to 150 degrees descend to 4000 feet. At 18:13 Zurich Arrival radioed: ""[...] right heading two one five, cleared for the ILS approach two four, report established.""This was confirmed by the crew and read back correctly.Subsequently, the radar controller observed that the aircraft crossed the localizer slightly at 4000 feet at a speed of approximately 240 KIAS, and began a rapid descent. The crew did not respond to repeated calls.At 18:14 the plane touched obstacles in a forest area directly west of Waldburg. It then flew at high speed, at a shallow angle, into another piece of forest about 1000 m away. The three occupants were fatally injured and the plane destroyed.A review of previous approaches to Friedrichshafen by OE-FWD showed that the localizer was intercepted at airspeeds between 220 and 240 knots. Every time the localizer was crossed after turning onto the final approach course.The investigation is continuing."
374,ACC2187,"The flight crew were conducting an ILS Category II  approach and landing on runway 27 at Bristol Airport. On touchdown they noticed that the aircraft de-rotated sharply. The pilot flying (PF) was unable to maintain directional control during the landing roll and the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway onto the grass. At some point during the landing the throttles were moved forward, reducing the rate of deceleration. As the aircraft left the paved surface the crew realised that the landing had been carried out with the Emergency/Parking brake set. The aircraft may have remained on the runway surface but for the addition of forward thrust during the landing roll."
375,ACC2188,"A BAe-748 cargo plane operated by Bismillah Airlines suffered a left hand main gear collapsed while taxiing after landing at Jessore Airport, Bangladesh.The flight departed Cox's Bazar Airport at 10:53 hours local time and landed on runway 34 at Jessore Airport at 12:03.After clearing the runway via Romeo while taxying into and following the eastern taxy yellow guide line for parking into the BAY-1 at Jessore apron, the captain noticed four amber caution lights illuminate on the hydraulic panel. Subsequently, the captain noticed he lost the response of nose wheel steering. Upon application of brakes, there was no response. Soon after the captain and co-pilot checked and found hydraulic quantity reduced with zero pressure. The aircraft veered to the left and went out of the concrete apron into the soft ground. This resulted the left main wheel  striking a concrete slab causing the affected wheel to bend rearward and collapse. The left engine propeller struck the ground. As per the captain and first officer, at that time, both tried to build-up hydraulic pressure with the hand pump but to no avail.4. According to the captain, he carried out a visual inspection and observed that the hydraulic reservoir installed in right hand engine was completely depleted."

377,ACC2190,"Dana Air flight 363 departed Abuja for Port Harcourt, Nigeria at 18:06 hours local time. The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was the Pilot Monitoring (PM).Following an uneventful en route part of the flight, the aircraft was issued descent clearances to FL220 and then further down to FL80.During descent, the PF briefed for the localizer approach to runway 21.Port Harcourt Approach then reported the presence of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds along the approach path of runway 21, and requested flight 363 to report intentions. Dana 363 responded ""I will like to come closer then we take our decision I will advise"". Meanwhile, the Tower controller informed the Approach controller that the intensity of rain had increased to heavy rain.At 18:43 Arik Air 766 peformed a go around on the approach to runway 03 due to windshear. At 18:45, Dana 363 was cleared for the LOC approach to runway 21. Shortly afterwards the captain took over control after realizing the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) 2 was unserviceable.When the aircraft was 12 miles to touch down, the Approach controller instructed the flight to contact Tower. The crew was engaged in changing the frequencies on the navigation radio receivers since the VOR DME was not showing.An initial attempt by the PM to contact the Tower was not on the correct frequency, during which both Tower and Approach were trying to contact the aircraft. Approximately 1.5 minutes after the first attempt, contact with the Tower was established on the correct frequency.The captain then instructed the first officer to watch out for the runway. A few seconds after, the captain was heard yelling for wipers. After a while, the captain sighted the runway and instructed the first officer to report this to the Tower controller. Thirty-two seconds later, an aural warning ""Sink rate""! ""Sink rate""!! ""Sink rate""!!! ""Sink rate""!!!! came on.The aircraft descended through approach minimums (460 feet AGL), crossed the threshold and did a smooth touchdown on the runway at 7972 feet from the threshold in high winds of 360°/22 kt. The aircraft landed without obtaining landing clearance from the Tower controller.Landing Distance Available (LDA) for runway 21 was 9843 feet which left a remaining length of 1871 feet for the aircraft to stop.According to the captain, during landing roll, the brakes were applied while simultaneously deploying thrust reversers to maximum; all spoilers automatically deployed after the nose wheel touched the ground. The crew continued to apply brakes until maximum braking was commanded. The aircraft could not be stopped during brake application and the captain continued applying the brake pedals to maximum.The aircraft was on the centreline until it veered off left approximately 200 feet from the end of the runway, exited the paved surface and came to a stop 978 feet from the end of the runway After the aircraft came to a complete stop, engines were shut down and emergency power switch was turned ON. The emergency light came ON, all other lights were OFF and the Public Address System was not working, the lead crew had to open the cockpit door to obtain emergency evacuation instructions from the captain.Emergency evacuation was carried out using only the left forward main door and the escape slide on this door did not deploy. All persons on board were evacuated unhurt."
378,ACC2191,"The pilot reported that during the landing roll, following a normal landing, he heard a loud bang, after which the aircraft nose appeared to be lower than normal. He stopped the aircraft and shut it down to carry out an inspection. This identified that the nose landing gear drag link spring had failed.A detailed analysis of the failed part, carried out on behalf of the operator, indicated that the failure was most likely due to damage to the protective coating which had allowed the high-strength steel material to be exposed to moisture. A corrosion fatigue mechanism then led to the crack which resulted in the failure."
379,ACC2192,"The Beech B100 King Air aircraft operated by Island Express Air, was conducting flight 640 from Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada to San Bernardino, California, USA with one pilot and 9 passengers on board.Weather conditions at Abbotsford at the time of departure consisted of a temperature of -2°C in moderate to heavy snowfall with winds of approximately 10 knots. Prior to the departure, the fuel tanks were filled to capacity and the pilot and passengers boarded the aircraft inside the operator's heated hangar. The aircraft was towed outside of the hangar without being treated with anti-ice fluid, and taxied for the departure on runway 07. Due to an inbound arrival at Abbotsford, C-GIAE was delayed for departure. Once cleared for takeoff, the aircraft had been exposed to snow and freezing conditions for approximately 13 minutes. Approximately 4 to 5 seconds after takeoff, the pilot selected the landing gear control to the up position. As the gear retracted, the aircraft rolled approximately 30° to the left. To correct the uncommanded left bank, the pilot applied right aileron, and the aircraft returned to a near wings-level attitude. In order to make an immediate off-field emergency landing, the pilot retarded the power levers and then applied forward pressure on the control column to land the aircraft. The aircraft struck terrain between runway 07 and taxiway C. The aircraft slid across the snow-covered ground for approximately 760 feet before coming to rest in a raspberry patch located on the airport property.Four passengers and the pilot sustained serious injuries as a result of the accident which destroyed the aircraft."
380,ACC2193,"The Beechcraft 99 sustained serious damage in a failed landing attempt at Pilot Point Airport, Alaska, USA.The pilot reported that, after exiting instrument meteorological conditions during a circling approach, he was ""a little above"" the normal glidepath; as the airplane crossed the approach end of the runway, the airplane began to sink rapidly and drift to the left. He added power to initiate a go-around, but the airplane continued to sink and landed with the left main landing gear off the left side of the runway. As the airplane became airborne again, he attempted to retract the landing gear, ""but the handle was lockedin place."" He noticed that the left and right main landing gear extension lights were illuminated, but the nose landing gear light was not. The pilot noticed a positive rate of climb and decided to fly to King Salmon Airport, Alaska.The pilot reported that, while en route to the alternate airport, a passenger reported that they smelled smoke, so he turned off electrical equipment. A pilot-rated passenger assisted with circuit breaker troubleshooting before turning on the battery again for communications. He instructed the pilot-rated passenger to visually examine the landing gear; the passenger reported that the left main landing gear was extended without damage and the right main landing gear was ""bent back,"" with damage to the rightflap with fuel leaking from the wing. After contacting the alternate airport's tower, the pilot reported that he declared an emergency and provided a safety brief to the passengers. He added that, at the alternate airport, he performed an instrument landing system approach, and over the approach end of the runway, he reduced power, feathered the propellers, and moved both fuel levers to fuel cutoff. During landing, the right main landing gear collapsed, the right wing settled onto the runway, and the airplane began to pull to the right. The pilot added left rudder to maintain the runway centerline and the airplane came to rest on the runway.The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing."
381,ACC2194,"The Antonov An-12 transport plane carried fresh food from Châlons-Vatry, France, to Gao in Mali for the French armed forces that were stationed there. Arriving on final approach at the airport, the limited visibility prompted the crew to carry out a go-around and divert to Bamako. In the early afternoon, judging that the conditions were improving, the crew took off again and made it to the final approach on the laterite runway 07R of Gao. With visibility reduced to 3,000 metres and the runway difficult to spot, the crew requested Gao air traffic control to mark the runway threshold with flashing lights.The crew only perceived this secondary runway late and made corrections to line up on the runway axis on short final. As a result, the approach was not stabilized. This unstable final approach resulted in a late and poorly controlled flare.The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced back three times. One or more of these contacts with the runway produced excessive forces on the nose gear and its fracture.The aircraft slid over the front of the fuselage for 500 metres before coming to rest. The crew shut down the engines and systems, then evacuated the aircraft on their own."

After about 30 minutes, the aircraft was scheduled to take off again. The pilot-in-command had taken the precaution to inspect the runway. The airstrip at Kamonia is almost unused, with Tussock grasses and sand banks on half of the airstrip. It was decided to take off from runway 34; on the first hundreds of meters the ground is compact. After lining up on runway 34 the PIC briefed the co-pilot explaining his choice, and that he wanted to do a ""soft takeoff procedure"". On take-off, the PIC selected take-off power and the aircraft began taxiing. Arriving on the sandy section, the acceleration of the aircraft was no longer progressing as expected. When the crew saw the aircraft approaching the end of the runway, the only option was to try to pull up. For fear of stalling, the angle of climb was kept low. The cargo pod on the bottom of the aircraft and the nosewheel gear touched an embankment. With all the inertia, the aircraft flipped over, coming to rest on its back. Three occupants escaped unharmed and two sustained minor injuries. The fire, which began to spread to the surrounding area, was quickly brought under control using the on-board fire extinguishers."

It was being operated by a single pilot who had considerable experience on both the aircraft type and in operating in the Falkland Islands. This was his first day back after a period of leave, having returned to the Falkland Islands the previous day from a stay overseas.Weddell Island was experiencing a southerly wind at the time the pilot took off so he was expecting to land on runway 13 at Beaver Island. Whilst downwind for runway 13 he contacted his destination by radio to be informed that the wind strength and directionfavoured instead an approach to runway 27. The pilot then repositioned the aircraft for runway 27, rolling out of the final turn on short final. Video footage taken by the passengers on board recorded that about 8 seconds after rolling out onto final the stall warning horn sounded, quickly followed by an impact as the aircraft appeared to touch down hard. The pilot reported that he had felt the right wing drop just before the impact.A later inspection revealed marks from the left wheel on a small bank about 14.5 m short of the start of the runway undershoot area and from the right wheel about 12.4 m short. There were further marks from both wheels indicating the aircraft had struck further banks before both wheels remained on the ground 3.5 m inside the undershoot area. During the subsequent landing roll the aircraft veered initially to the right but the pilot managed to keep it under control. He taxied the aircraft clear of the runway before shutting down. On inspecting the aircraft it was apparent there was significant damage to the right landing gear, engine mounts and wing."
393,ACC2206,"The Spirit Avia Sentosa Cessna 208B was conducting unscheduled passenger flights. The flights of the day planned for the pilots were from Douw Aturure Airport (WABI), Nabire to Sugapa Airstrip (WAYB) and return for three times. The PIC acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the SIC acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) on all these flights.After the third flight from Nabire to Bilorai, the aircraft landed safely at Sugapa Airstrip. Prior to the departure to Nabire, there was no report or record of aircraft system malfunction and the aircraft was operated within the approved weight and balance envelope. On board the aircraft were two pilots and 11 passengers.The aircraft departed from in daylight conditions and cruised at an altitude of 10,500 feet. The aircraft was flying in an out through clouds when approaching Nabire.Over checkpoint BRAVO, the pilot made initial contact with Nabire Tower controller and advised that the aircraft was descending and passed altitude of 6,600 feet.During descent after checkpoint BRAVO, the pilot noticed development of clouds along the route and decided to avoid the clouds by deviating the aircraft track to the right of the GPS route.At about 4.5 Nm from NBR VOR/DME, the flight monitoring system of the Spirit Avia Sentosa recorded the aircraft altitude was 2,000 feet.The PM noticed yellow on the aircraft GPS which meant the terrain was between 1,000 feet and 100 feet below the aircraft altitude and advised the PF. The PF decided to disengage the auto pilot, reduced the rate of descend and continued to get visual reference on ground.The PM noticed an ""X"" symbol on the GPS which indicated a potential impact point and advised the PF. The PF was continuing the descent and then the second ""X"" appeared on the GPS. A few second later, the PF noticed terrain ahead and pulled the aircraft. The left side of the aircraft impacted a tree.At about 2 Nm, the pilot advised the controller of the aircraft position and requested to make a landing approach using runway 16. The controller approved the pilot request. The rest of the flight was uneventful and the aircraft landed safely using runway 16 at Nabire.No one injured in this occurrence and the aircraft was substantially damaged. Evidence of impact marks were found on the left side of the aircraft which were on the main landing gear strut, wing strut fairing, wing and horizontal stabilizer"
394,ACC2207,"After landing, the plane was shot at by Papua separatists. The airframe sustained bullet holes. The captain was injured as a result of a gunshot.The aircraft carried 18 personnel who were to be deployed to guard a local election to be held on June 27, 2018.This was the second such incident in three days time."
395,ACC2208,The Antonov An-2R aircraft engaged in a forest fire survey flight nosed over during a forced landing on an island in the Uda River. The aircraft had just departed Nizhneudinsk Airport.
396,ACC2209,"A DHC-3T Vazar Turbine Otter float plane impacted rocky, mountainous, rising terrain of Mount Jumbo on Prince of Wales Island in Alaska, USA in low cloud conditions. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. Of the 11 occupants on board, the pilot was uninjured, four passengers sustained minor injuries, and six passengers sustained serious injuries.The float plane had departed Steamboat Bay Seaplane Base about 07:47 and was headed for Ketchikan, Alaska. The area between Steamboat Bay and Ketchikan consists of remote inland fjords, coastal waterways, and steep mountainous terrain.The accident pilot reported to the NTSB that while in level cruise flight at about 1,100 ft mean sea level (MSL), and as the flight progressed into an area known as Sulzer Portage, visibility decreased rapidly from about 3-5 miles to nil. In an attempt to turnaround and return to VFR conditions, he initiated a climbing right turn. Prior to completing the 180° right turn, he saw what he believed to be a body of water and he became momentarily disoriented, so he leveled the wings. Shortly thereafter, he realized that the airplane was approaching an area of snow-covered mountainous terrain, so he applied full power and initiated a steep, emergency climb to avoid rising terrain ahead. As the steep emergency climb continued, the airspeed decayed, and the airplane subsequently collided with an area of rocky, rising terrain. During the initial impact, the airplane's floats were sheared off. The airplane wreckage came to rest in an area known as Jumbo Mountain, sustaining substantial damage to wings and fuselage. The pilot stated that the Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) was in the inhibit mode at the time of the accident. A ""First Alert"" was received from the accident airplane's onboard emergency locator transmitter (ELT) at 09:11. About the same time, 911 dispatch in Ketchikan talked to a survivor who provided GPS position and elevation based on data from her iPhone. At 10:47 two US Coast Guard helicopters arrived in the search area and one helicopter obtained a weak direction finding (DF) bearing from the ELT at the crash scene. The DF bearing, and the survivor's description of the accident area were used to direct search assets in close proximity to the accident site, so the survivors could hear the USCG helicopters. Two-way radio communications were established between the survivors and USCG by utilizing the accident airplane's radio. The USCG located the accident site at 11:56. At 13:08 all 11 survivors had been hoisted into the USCG's rescue helicopter and transferred to the staging area for transport back to Ketchikan,. The accident site was located on a rock face on the east side of Jumbo Mountain at an elevation of about 2,557 ft msl. All the airplane major components were located at the accident site."
397,ACC2210,"The Curtiss C-46F cargo plane made a precautionary landing at Manley Hot Springs Airport in Alaska, USA, following the loss of engine power on one of the two engines.During the landing in tailwind conditions, the airplane touched down ""a little fast,"" according to the pilot. The airplane was unable to stop and overran the end of the runway, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage.On July 24 the wings (outboard of the engines) and tail were removed and the aircraft was towed over the road to a river. From there it was barged to Fairbanks for repairs."
398,ACC2211,"A Douglas C-47, named ""Bluebonnet Belle"", was involved in an accident during takeoff from runway 19 at Burnet Municipal Airport, Texas, USA. The aircraft came to rest in the grass next to the runway and burst into flames. The captain, crew chief, and 4 passengers sustained serious injuries, 1 passenger sustained minor injuries, and the co-pilot and 5 passengers were not injured.The aircraft was to be flown to a fly-in at Oshkosh, Wisconsin.The co-pilot, who was the flying pilot reported that prior to the flight, it was briefed that he would perform the takeoff. He stated that the captain taxied the airplane to the runup area, where all pre-takeoff checks were completed; the captain then taxied the airplane onto runway 19. The co-pilot further stated that he then took control of the airplane, provided a pre-takeoff brief, and initiated the takeoff sequence. About 10 seconds into the takeoff roll, the airplane drifted right, at which time he applied left rudder input. This was followed shortly by the captain saying that he had the airplane. The captain, who was the non-flying pilot, reported to the NTSB that during the initial stages of the takeoff roll, he didn't recall the airplane swerving to the right, however, recalled telling the co-pilot not to push the tail up because it was heavy; he also remembered the airplane swerving to the left shortly thereafter. The captain stated that he yelled ""right rudder"" three times before taking control of the airplane. He said that as he put his hands on the control yoke, he noticed that either the tail started to come down or the main wheels were either light or were just coming off the ground as it exited the left side of the runway. The captain said that he knew the airplane was slow as he tried to ease it over [to the runway] and set it back down. Subsequently, he felt the 'shutter of a stall,"" and the airplane turned to the left and impacted the ground. After the airplane came to a stop, a postimpact fire ensued, during which all the occupants of the airplane egressed through the aft left door. A video of the takeoff and accident sequence shows the aircraft accellerating on the runway, with the tailwheel leaving the ground very briefly. A few seconds after the tailwheel touched down again, the aircraft seems to drift off the left side of the runway. The aircraft banks right, causing the left hand main landing gear to become airborne. The right hand wing tip touched or almost touched the ground before the aircraft became airborne. The left wing dropped and the wing tip touched the ground, causing the plane to slew to the left and touch down again. The right hand main gear then seems to fold as the aircraft comes to rest in a cloud of dust.Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane came to rest upright on a heading of about 113° magnetic, about 145 ft east of the left side, and 2,638 ft from the approach end of runway 19. The postimpact fire consumed the fuselage from the nose cone aft to about 3 ft forward of the left side cargo door along with a majority of the wing center section. No evidence of any flight control locks was found installed. The tailwheel locking pin was found in place and was sheered into multiple pieces. Vegetation (grass) within about 200 ft of the main wreckage was burnt from the postimpact fire. The wreckage was recovered to a secure location for further examination."
399,ACC2212,"On 18 July 2018, following a flight from Luton Airport (EGGW), the aircraft landed at Cork Airport (EICK) and parked on Stand 16. After the passengers had disembarked, the two pilots carried out post-flight checks and secured the aircraft. The aircraft remained on Stand 16 until the 22 July 2018 when the pilots returned to prepare the aircraft for a flight to Gander, Canada (CYQX).Prior to departure for CYQX, the flight crew carried out pre-flight checks of the exterior of the aircraft and cockpit setup, dividing the tasks between the two crew members. During this process the pilot installed the Torque Link Release Pin on the nose landing gear. This pin is used to connect the upper and lower torque links on the nose gear leg to allow nose gear steering. However, the torque links were not connected and the pin was inadvertently just installed on the upper torque link.When the six passengers arrived, they boarded promptly and final preparations for departure were completed. The aircraft taxied the short distance from Stand 16 to runway 16 using taxiway Alpha. While taxiing, the captain experienced some difficulties in turning the nose wheel. He discussed his concerns with the Second-In-Command (SIC) who confirmed that the relevant pre-flight inspection of the nose gear had been completed. Both pilots focussed on the location of the Torque Link Release Pin (i.e. ""the pin was in"") and did not discuss the status of the assembly (disconnected or connected).The aircraft turned onto the runway and began the take-off roll. At a groundspeed of 67 kts the captain aborted the take-off due to a significant vibration of the nose wheel. The maximum recorded ground speed was 74 kts, after which the aircraft decelerated and came to rest on runway 16, where it was attended by Cork Airport Fire Services (AFS). Once the AFS had inspected the aircraft, the passengers disembarked through the main cabin door onto runway 16. The nose gear leg and nose structure of the aircraft suffered significant damage. During the accident sequence, the lower part of the nose gear leg turned through approximately 90 degrees, both tyres burst and disintegrated, leading to significant wear on the hub of the forward wheel."
400,ACC2213,"An aircraft operated by Air Kasai was destroyed when it crashed and burned 3 km from Kamako, Democratic Republic of the Congo. There are said to have been seven persons on board the aircraft. The pilot and passenger survived the accident.The Antonov An-2 operated on a mixed cargo/passenger flight from Tshikapa to Kamako, Nsumbula, Diboko and back to Tshikapa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.After take-off from Kamako, climbing to 3500 feet, the pilot noticed a flock of birds. Some minutes later, he noticed that the engine was beginning to lose power. Thinking that he had flown through a group of birds, he decided to return to Kamako Airstrip.The elevation of the land in this area varies between 2000 and 2500 feet of altitude.Without engine power, he began to lose altitude on the right downwind leg of the approach. Being unable to reach the Kamako, the pilot steered into a valley between two hills. During the attempted forced landing the aircraft hit a tree canopy and fell to the ground, bursting into flames. The pilot and the passenger next to him escaped with minor injuries."
401,ACC2214,"A Junkers Ju-52/3m aircraft, operated by Ju-Air, was destroyed in an accident in a mountainous area in Switzerland. The aircraft crashed into the western slope of Piz Segnas at an elevation of 2540 m. All 17 passengers and three crew members were killed.The aircraft had departed Locarno, Switzerland, at 16:10 on a flight to its home base at Dübendorf.The aircraft flew on a northeasterly course into the basin southwest of Piz Segnas. Towards the north end of the basin, it began a left turn, which developed into a descending spiral trajectory. A short time later, the aircraft collided with the ground almost vertically and at high speed.Following the crash, all Swiss Junkers Ju-52 aircraft were grounded. Ju-Air was allowed to restart operations on August 17 with the two remaining aircraft of the same type. Since there were no indications of general technical defects at this time, the FOCA had approved the resumption of flight operations in compliance with precautionary measures.On November 20, the Swiss TSB published an interim report. There was still no evidence that a serious technical problem led to the accident. The investigation of the wreck, however, revealed severe structural damage in the form of cracks and corrosion on the main spar, the supporting element of the aircraft wing, and other parts of the aircraft. This damage was hidden during normal inspections and maintenance and could only be determined from the debris. Since the two Ju-52 HB-HOP and HB-HOS stationed in Dübendorf correspond in age as well as in hours of operation to the crashed aircraft, the Swiss authorities temporarily grounded both aircraft for inspections."
402,ACC2215,"The aircraft, en route for the US with automotive parts, diverted to San Luis Potosí in Mexico with engine problems. It however conducted a forced landing about 2 miles from the airport, struck a small building and came to rest in a field. The crew had minor injuries. A house was damaged and a donkey was killed."

404,ACC2217,"An Airbus A321, N204HA, operated by Hawaiian Airlines as flight 56 from Kahului Airport, Hawaii, USA (OGG) to Los Angeles International Airport, California, USA (LAX), had a tail strike upon landing on runway 6R at LAX. The ILS approach to runway 6R was stable. At approximately 1,500 feet, the crew received a GPWS Fail ECAM message. They performed the ECAM actions, which required them to turn off the GPWS. They did not receive the standard altitude call-outs, such as 50, 40, 30, etc. Because the flying pilot was expecting the call outs and did not receive them, he was late to flare and they struck the runway firmly. They proceeded to bounce and the pitch attitude increased. The flying pilot then lowered the nose and they continued the landing without further incident."
405,ACC2218,"Operating on a flight from Elizabeth City Coast Guard Air Station, North Carolina, to deploy a weather buoys during a multi-stop aerial surveillance mission, the aircraft ditched to the waters struck something in the water upon takeoff, 425 miles offshoreof Cape Hatteras. The airplane sustained substantial damage and the uninjured five occupants were brought aboard a passing Automated Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue System (AMVER) equipped container vessel. Location at 2100Z on 25 Aug 2018 as reported by Bermuda Radio - 31-10.5N 070-01.6W. The aircraft subsequently sank."
406,ACC2219,"During a regular flight between Araracuara (SKAC) and Florencia (SKFL), the crew of the Y-12E aircraft encountered cumulonimbus clouds. The crew decided to cross the formation, assuming they would only experience light turbulence; however, the effect of the turbulence caused the aircraft to descend 5500 ft uncontrolled, in a few seconds, to an altitude of 5000 ft.The crew regained control, and landed without further problems at 16:09. As a result of the event, one passenger suffered minor injuries. Due to the cumulonimbus crossing the aircraft suffered severe structural damage."
407,ACC2220,"A Boeing 767-300 aircraft operated by Air Canada Rouge, was conducting flight 1940 from Vancouver, Canada to Dublin, Ireland with 8 crew members and 257 passengers on board. As the aircraft was climbing through 10000 feet shortly after the departure from Vancouver, the flight crew heard a loud bang coming from the number 2 engine (Pratt & Whitney PW4060-3), associated with a power loss and abnormal engine indications. The number 2 engine was brought to idle, and a MAYDAY was declared. The flight subsequently returned to Vancouver where an overweight landing was executed with ARFF on standby. There were no injuries. Following the landing, the Vancouver Airport Authorities detected debris on runway 08R/26L, and closed it to clean it up.An initial visual inspection of the engine revealed extensive damage to the aft-most turbine blades. The inboard aileron and the fuselage just aft of the baggage door were punctured by debris exiting the engine exhaust duct. The engine was sent to the manufacturer for teardown and inspection.The damage was limited to the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) section, from the stage 4 vanes to the stage 6 turbine blades."
408,ACC2221,"A CL-415 aircraft operated by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, departed from Gander International Airport (CYQX), Canada to conduct aerial firefighting operations near Whitehead Pond, NL. The flight crew inspected several lakes and selected Whitehead Pond for scooping water while fighting a fire approximately 8 nm to the South West. While making the sixth water scoop run along the lake, the flight crew heard a loud bang. The flight crew suspected that they had struck hidden rocks, so full power was applied and a go around was conducted. Both left water drop doors indicated open, and the hydraulic quantity indicated low. The hydraulic pressure was normal, and airspeed below maximum open door speed was maintained for the return to CYQX. While enroute, attempts to close the doors were unsuccessful. The flight crew completed the checklist related to the low hydraulic quantity, manually jettisoned the remaining water, and landed without further incident at CYQX.The aircraft's lower left hull sustained substantial damage."
409,ACC2222,"A Hawker Siddeley HS125-700A, N109BG, veered to the right during landing roll at the Santa Fe Municipal Airport, New Mexico, USA. The pilot subsequently tried to correct to the runway centerline; however, the airplane came to rest in the grass adjacent to the runway. The pilot and four passengers were not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage. The pilot reported that during the landing roll, he attempted to use the nose wheel tiller to steer the airplane on the ground; however, the tiller was locked and the pilot was unable to twist the tiller counterclockwise. The pilot was able to lift the nose wheel off the runway to regain control and the airplane came to rest in the nearby grassy area."
410,ACC2223,"A Berry Aviation Embraer EMB-120ER, N233SW, found substantial damage to the cargo area after arriving at Queretaro International Airport (MMQT), Mexico. The two flight crew members were not injured.  The flight was being operated as a cargo flight from Shreveport Regional Airport (KSHV), Louisiana, to MMQT.   While in cruise flight in Houston, Texas, airspace, the flight crew noticed a storm cell on the weather radar, however, they continued on their routing since they would stay south of the storm.  While passing the storm, they encountered severe turbulence for a short period of time. The flight crew notified ATC of the location of the severe turbulence and continued the flight.   Upon arrival at MMQT, the flight crew entered the cargo area where they noticed several panels had fallen and were hanging from their attachment points. Further maintenance inspection revealed buckling to four fuselage frames and four floor support structures that covered an area several feet long.  The damage was classified as substantial as it would adversely affect the structural strength of the fuselage.  The flight crew reported they picked up four pallets of cargo at John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport (CYHM), Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.  Two of the pallets were loaded in zone 2 and two were loaded into zone 3.  The pallets were secured with vertical cargo nets.  The flight crew departed CYHM at 1322 UTC and arrived at KSHV at 1657 to clear US customs and to take on fuel.  They departed KSHV at 1727 UTC for MMQT.  After the accident, the operator reminded flight crews to fly 5 or more miles away from thunderstorm cells identified on the weather radar and to secure cargo better to decrease the likelihood that it will shift during turbulence encounters. "
411,ACC2224,"A Boeing 737-800 operated by Air Niugini as flight 73 impacted the water of Chuuk Lagoon about 1,500 ft (460 m) short of the runway 04 threshold, during its approach Chuuk International Airport, Micronesia. The aircraft took off from Pohnpei at 22:22 on a flight to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea via Chuuk. The PIC was the pilot flying for the sector to Chuuk. The copilot was the monitoring pilot. The engineer for the flight was seated in the cockpit jump seat during the approach. Prior to top of descent the crew briefly discussed brake setting for the landing and discussed the approach and landing flap setting. They agreed to select Flap 40. They then discussed the approach and missed approach procedure they would conduct at HAMAX if they found themselves not visual by that point. However, the approach and landing checklist and the briefing on the RNAV approach chart briefings were not conducted in accordance with the SOPs and not using standard phraseology. At top of descent, the PIC stated to the copilot that they were already high and needed to immediately initiate their descent. The crew commenced their descent leaving FL400 at 22:56, at a descent rate of 944 ft/pm. At FL340, the copilot contacted San Francisco radio and reported that they were maintaining FL340. Both pilots discussed the descent clearance for about two minutes, trying to recall and clarify the instructions that they were given. At 23:05, while maintaining FL340, the PIC stated to the copilot that they were high on profile and needed to descend to get back on the required descent profile. At 23:08, the PIC said ""alright, we catching back on profile, so just keep the speed up"". The copilot contacted Chuuk radio at 23:08 and requested a weather update. At 23:11, Chuuk radio contacted the crew with the weather update for Chuuk stating: ""wind variable at 5, visibility 14 scattered 012 charlie bravo, broken 120 overcast 280, temperature 26 dep point 25, altimeter 2973"". At 23:15, at about 15 nm from Chuuk while passing 8,600 ft, the copilot made an inbound broadcast call stating their intention to track for the RNAV (GPS) runway 04, from the east south-east. Five minutes later the copilot made a general broadcast, stating that they were established on 041 inbound via the RNAV (GPS) runway 04. The aircraft was then configured for the approach. At 1000 feet the aircraft was stable but above the 3 degrees glidepath. At 23:23 the PIC disconnected the auto-pilot and stated: ""Im going back on profile."" When passing 548 ft (602 ft Radio Altitude) on descent, the aircraft entered the storm cell and heavy rain and the PIC called for the wipers to be switched on. After passing the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA), between 307 ft (364 ft RA) fourteen 'Sink Rate' and 'Glideslope' aural alerts began to sound. The flight crew disregarded the alerts, and did not acknowledge the ""minimums"" and 100 ft alerts. After descending through 100 feet the copilot noticed they were dangerously low and called rapidly with high intonation: ""Too low! Were too low! Were too low! Were too low!"" The aircraft then skipped across the water several times before it settled in the water and turned clockwise through 210 deg and drifted 460 ft (140 m) south east of the runway 04 extended centreline, with the nose of the aircraft pointing about 265 degrees. Local boaters rescued 28 passengers and two cabin crew from the left over-wing exits. Two cabin crew, the two pilots and the engineer were rescued by local boaters from the forward door 1L. One life raft was launched from the left aft over-wing exit by cabin crew CC5 with the assistance of a passenger. The US Navy divers rescued six passengers and four cabin crew and the Load Master from the right aft over-wing exit. All injured passengers were evacuated from the left over-wing exits. One passenger was fatally injured, and local divers located his body in the aircraft three days after the accident. The accident investigators concluded that both pilots were not situationally aware during the approach and did not recognise the developing significant unsafe condition after passing the Missed Approach Point (MAP) when the aircraft entered a storm cell and heavy rain. The weather radar on the PICs Navigation Display showed a large red area indicating a storm cell immediately after the MAP, between the MAP and the runway. The copilot as the monitoring pilot was ineffective and was oblivious to the rapidly unfolding unsafe situation. He did not recognise the significant unsafe condition and therefore did not realise the need to challenge the PIC and take control of the aircraft, as required by the Air Niugini SOP. Training records showed that the copilot had been checked in the simulator for EGPWS Alert (Terrain) however there was no evidence of simulator check sessions covering the vital actions and responses required to retrieve a perceived or real situation that might compromise the safe operation of the aircraft. Specifically sustained unstabilised approach below 1,000 ft amsl in IMC as in the case of the accident. The PIC did not conduct the missed approach at the MAP despite the criteria required for visually continuing the approach not being met, including visually acquiring the runway or the PAPI. The PIC did not conduct a go around after passing the MAP and subsequently the MDA although: the aircraft had entered IMC; the approach was unstable; the glideslope indicator on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) was showing a rapid glideslope deviation from a half-dot low to 2-dots high within 9 seconds after passing the MDA; the rate of descent was high (more than 1,000 ft/min) and increasing; there were EGPWS Sink Rate and Glideslope aural alerts; and the EGPWS visual PULL UP warning message was displayed on the PFD."

413,ACC2226,"The aircraft experienced a runway excursion while landing on runway 31 at Barrow County Airport (KWDR) in Winder, Georgia, USA. The aircraft came to the rest in the grass, hitting several lights and a sign, and the occupants on board were not injured."
414,ACC2227,"PAL Airlines flight 1922, a DHC-8-300 aircraft, en route to Deer Lake, NL (CYDF) with 47 passengers and 4 crew onboard had an indication of a potential nose landing gear issue. At 10:57 local time, during the approach at Deer Lake, the flight crew selected the landing gear down; however, a weight on wheels caution light as well as advisory lights illuminated, indicating that the nose landing gear was not in the down-and-locked position. The flight crew executed a missed approach and entered a hold in order to troubleshoot the problem. At 12:02, the flight crew requested a diversion to Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, and declared an emergency. At 12:30, the aircraft landed on runway 27 at Stephenville with the nose landing gear in a partially extended position. On touchdown, the nose landing gear fully collapsed, and the aircraft nose structure came into contact with the runway surface. The aircraft slid and came to a stop approximately halfway down the runway.There were no injuries to passengers or crew."

416,ACC2229,"The pilot of a Desert-Air Safaris Beech B200, registered VH-ODI (ODI), prepared to conduct a charter flight from Adelaide, Australia to Mount Gambier with seven passengers on board. One of the passengers occupied the right flight deck seat as an observer. This observer held a commercial pilot licence, but was not a member of the flight crewAt 11:09, the flight departed Adelaide Airport. During the flight, the pilot received a Special Weather Report (SPECI), stating overcast cloud at 512 ft AMSL, below the approach minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 730 ft AMSL. The SPECI also reported visibility greater than 10 km and a southerly wind of 11 kt.At 12:00, ODI commenced the Runway 18 RNAV approach behind a preceding aircraft. As the preceding aircraft continued the approach, the flight crew of that aircraft received an alert indicating the loss of the GNSS receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and conducted a go-around.Despite not receiving a similar alert, the pilot of ODI also elected to conduct a go-around. He climbed the aircraft to an altitude of 5,000 feet and proceeded with the missed approach procedure to waypoint MTGNE to commence another approach. The other aircraft then advised that they would hold at waypoint MTGND while ODI conducted another approach.At 12:15, ODI commenced a second approach to Runway 18 from waypoint MTGNE.During the flight and approaches, the observer contributed to the operation of the aircraft, a.o. by calling out operational checklists and monitoring the approach and calling out excursions from the target altitude.The approach chart indicated that a normal descent profile should position the aircraft at 980 ft, 2 NM prior to the missed approach point at MTGNM. As the aircraft crossed this point, the pilot announced that the aircraft was 'too fast by far' and 'high'.On multiple occasions throughout the approach, the pilot questioned and corrected information provided by the observer and educated her on the operation of the flight.As the aircraft descended to 730ft, the observer announced that they had reached the MDA. Upon reaching the MDA, the pilot could see the ground directly beneath the aircraft, but could not see the runway ahead. He then announced that he would conduct a go-around and retracted the landing gear, without announcing that he had done so. The observer was unaware that the landing gear had been retracted. After the pilot announced the go-around, the engine power level did not increase.Nine seconds after the landing gear was retracted, the pilot and observer sighted the runway. The pilot then reduced power and selected full flap to continue the approach. He noted that the required approach profile from that position was 'very steep'.At that time, the landing gear warning tone activated. As the approach continued, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) 'check gear' aural alert also activated. In response, the pilot incorrectly announced that the landing gear was extended. The approach continued, and 5 seconds later the GPWS alert 'pull up' also activated. The observer announced that the 'pull up' warning had activated. The pilot acknowledged this call, announced 'I've got it' and continued the approach. One second later, the 'pull up' and 'check gear' alerts ceased, but the landing gear warning tone continued (the pilot and observer both later recalled not hearing the landing gear warning tone or GPWS 'check gear' alerts).At 12:22, the aircraft briefly touched down on the propellers and bounced. Two seconds later, the propellers again contacted the runway. The pilot, believing the landing gear was down and the aircraft had landed on the runway, twice attempted unsuccessfully to engage reverse thrust.The aircraft continued flying above the runway at low level and began to drift right toward the runway edge. The pilot, believing the aircraft to be rolling on the landing gear and not responding to brake inputs, assessed that it could not be stopped in the remaining runway and elected to conduct a go-around. He then increased engine power and observed good initial response from both engines followed shortly after by failure of the left engine.The pilot completed the initial engine failure actions and announced 'gear up, flap up' and the landing gear warning tone then ceased operating, consistent with flap retraction. Following the flap retraction, the stall warning activated intermittently for 16 seconds.The pilot shut down and secured the left engine and assessed that the right engine was performing as expected. He then conducted a visual left circuit at an altitude of about 600-650 ft AMSL, and at 12:24 the aircraft landed on Runway 18 and vacated on to Runway 29 where it was shut down.The observer assisted with passenger disembarkation onto Runway 29 and escorted them clear of the runway. No persons were injured during the accident however, the aircraft was substantially damaged."
417,ACC2230,"A Britten-Norman BN-2A Islander, operated by Par-Avion, impacted mountainous terrain in the Southwest National Park in Tasmania, Australia. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, died in the crash.The aircraft departed Hobart Cambridge Airport in Tasmania at 07:48 hours local time on a repositioning flight to Bathurst Harbour Airport to pick up passengers. ADS-B position and altitude data showed the aircraft tracked to the south-west towards Bathurst Harbour. At about 08:16, the aircraft approached a gap in the Arthur Range known as 'the portals'. The portals are a saddle (lowest area) between the Eastern and Western Arthur Range, and was an optional route that the airline used between Cambridge and Bathurst Harbour when the cloud base prevented flight over the mountain range. After passing through the portals, the aircraft proceeded to conduct a number of turns below the height of the surrounding highest terrain. The final data point recorded was at about 08:28."
418,ACC2231,"The Dornier 228-201 took off from São Tomé Island Airport at 15:16 hours local time to Douala, Cameroon.After take off from Sao Tomé the crew noticed that with gear retraction the transition light did not go off and was on throughout the flight. During the approach to Douala and having selected the landing gear down, the crew realized that the nose gear was not down and only the main gear was extended and locked. The crew recycled the landing gear but to no avail. With this abnormal condition the crew decided to return to home base at São Tomé Airport.At 19:53 a forced nose gear-up landing was performed, resulting in substantial damage to the aircraft's nose area."
419,ACC2232,"An Antonov An-26B transport plane, operated by the Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, suffered an accident while attempting to land at Beni Airport, D.R. Congo.Photos from the scene suggest that the aircraft overran the runway at Beni. It went down a slope and broke upon impact. The left hand wing broke away outside of the no.1 engine. The remaining wing with the engines attached tilted down, causing the propellers to strike the ground. A localized post-impact fire erupted, but was contained by fire services.All occupants are said to have survived. The aircraft carried troops that were being deployed to the Beni region."
420,ACC2233,"RAF-AVIA performed a positioning flight with a Saab 340B aircraft from Riga, Latvia, for Savonlinna, Finland. The flight crew comprised the captain (Pilot Flying, PF) and the co-pilot (Pilot Not Flying, PNF). Also, a ground engineer was on board. The purpose was to ferry the aircraft to Savonlinna to restart scheduled flights between Savonlinna and Helsinki-Vantaa. The runway at Savonlinna was cleared from snow but there was packed snow at the edges. Because snow kept falling, the runway condition was considered 'poor', which was reported to the arriving aircraft.At 05:43 the captain reported being established on the ILS localiser. The AFIS officer reported that wind was 220 degrees at five knots and that runway 12 was free. The pilots used 20 degrees flap during the approach. According to the flight data recorder the approach was stable until the threshold. During the final approach the pilots saw the approach and runway lights well. Owing to the icing conditions they intended to use an airspeed which was 10 knots higher than the Aircraft Operations Manuals prescribed minimum approach speed. At the threshold their speed was 126 knots, while the approachs target speed was 120 knots.However, the airspeed at the touchdown zone markings was 123 knots. Contrasting from normal, the aircraft floated close to the surface for 6-7 seconds before touching down. The flight crew did not consider aborting the landing. Following the level flight the captain steered the aircraft toward the ground at a fairly high vertical speed. The aircraft touched down at 05:50, approximately 307 metres after the optimal touchdown point, on the left side of the runway. At touchdown the airspeed was 109 knots, which corresponds to the 110 knot target speed. Judging by the marks on the snow the left main landing gear hit the left snowbank on the uncleared area. The nose gear touched the runway, following which the left main gear became airborne for a moment and the right main gear touched the ground. The left main gear touched down again. After having travelled approximately 100 metres from the first touchdown point the aircrafts nose gear and the right main landing gear moved outside the cleared runway area.The aircraft was tracking towards the left, away from the direction of the runway. The pilots tried to turn the aircraft back towards the runway centreline. According to the markings the aircraft began to turn and started to skid sideways outside the cleared area of the runway.When the left main gear hit a high snowbank outside the runway, the aircraft began to turn more sharply to the left. The left engine stalled when snow entered its air intake. The pilots did not deploy reverse thrust. The right main gear knocked one runway edge light over. The aircraft stopped in half-metre deep snow outside the runway, at a 110 degree angle in relation to runway 12.The accident caused considerable damage to the aircraft. Both of the aircrafts propellers were damaged as well as the nose landing gear.The Safety Investigation Authority stated that this accident demonstrated the fact that the operating licences and air operator licences issued by the EU Member States aviation authorities do not guarantee constant and uniform safety levels among air carriers. While the EUs regulations have aimed at ensuring the most open participation in tendering, they may result in overlooking the safety of aviation as one criterion in tendering. The purchaser organising the public tender for air services will not necessarily impose any safety-associated criteria because of being cautious about breaking EU competition rules and the court processes launched by losing bidders. Often the price and on-time performance are the tender criteria. Purchasers of air services do not have suitable and straightforward indicators to assess air carrier safety. Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch."
421,ACC2234,"A Kalitta Charters Boeing 727-2B6F, N720CK, landed with the nose gear retracted on runway 4 at the Tuscaloosa Regional Airport (TCL), Alabama, USA. The airplane was substantially damaged and there were no injuries to the three flight crew and one non-revenue company mechanic onboard. The flight departed Laredo International Airport, Texas, USA at 18:26 CST on an IFR flight plan. There were no irregularities or operational issues reported during the takeoff and enroute portion of the flight. According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying when the accident occurred.At 19:58, the Birmingham Approach air traffic controller advised the crew that the wind at TCL was from 200 degrees at 4 knots. The crew acknowledged and advised that they would use runway 4. The controller instructed them to report the airport in sight. At 20:01, the crew reported the airport in sight, and the controller cleared them for the visual approach. There was no communication regarding any difficulty with the airplane.According to the flight crew, about 12 miles from the airport the captain called for flaps 15 and gear down. After the gear was selected down, the CVR recorded the first officer stating, ""yeah it's down, but [unintelligible] the lights [unintelligible]""The crew reported that they noted a red warning light for the nose gear position, and heard the audible gear warning horn. The CVR recorded the captain queried, ""what horn was that?"" and the first officer (FO) responded, ""[unintelligible] gear warning horn.""The flight engineer (FE) stated that he recommended that they recycle the gear, the captain declined. The FO stated that he recommended that they go around to troubleshoot, the captain declined. The CVR recorded multiple automated ""sink rate, pull up"" warnings and the captain responded, ""yeah, yeah, I got it."" The FO then queried, ""you gonna go around?"", and the captain responded, ""ah I'm gonna go I got, it, I got it.""The captain reportedly stated that the airplane had a history of a microswitch issue, and pressed on the gear handle and light. As the power was reduced to idle, the gear warning horn and the GPWS audible alerts sounded. The captain continued the approach and after landing, upon derotation, the forward fuselage contacted the runway and the airplane quickly slid to a stop with the nose gear retracted. After the airplane came to a stop, the captain stated, ""it wasn't down,"" and the FO made a radio call to tower. About five seconds later the FO stated, ""shoulda gone around,"" and the captain responded, ""yeah, shoulda."""
422,ACC2235,"The Air Tindi Beechcraft 200 King Air aircraft departed controlled flight during its initial descent and crashed near Whatì, Northwest Territories, Canada. Both pilots were killed.The aircraft operated flight 503, an instrument flight rules flight itinerary from Yellowknife to Whatì Airport, Wekweètì Airport, and Ekati Aerodrome. During the flight preparations at Yellowknife the first officer (FO) noted that the right-side vacuum-driven attitude indicator was not erect. The captain assured the FO that the instrument would start to operate. The flight took off from Yellowknife at 08:51.During the climb, while working the after-takeoff checklist, it appeared that the right-side ADI still wasn't working. The captain suggested to the FO that he should tap the attitude indicator to see if it was stuck or frozen. The FO replied that the attitude indicator was still not erect.While en route at FL120 the pilots attempted to troubleshoot the right-side attitude indicator, but to avail. At 09:11, after having commenced the descent, the captains attitude indicator on the left-side instrument panel displayed a red ""GYRO"" flag and the autopilot disconnected. At this time the captain began to manually fly the aircraft with partial flight instruments. The aircraft continued to descend, and the captain attempted to initiate a climb. The aircraft climbed briefly before beginning to descend again. The aircraft subsequently entered a gradual left turn that progressed into a steep descending left turn (spiral) from which the aircraft never recovered.The investigation established that both the captain and the FO had an iPad mini equipped with the ForeFlight Mobile application which had the capability to provide a backup attitude indication and synthetic vision view to both pilots. Since it was a backup feature, Air Tindi did not have a formal training program in place for using the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) feature of ForeFlight."
423,ACC2236,"Novair flight 158, an Airbus A321neo, suffered a hard landing accident at Billund Airport, Denmark.The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The en route flight, the descent and the initial approach for runway 27 at Billund proceeded uneventfully, with the aircraft being radar vectored for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach.On final approach to runway 27, Billund Tower cleared the aircraft to land and reported the wind conditions to be 200° 12 knots (kts), maximum 29 kts, and minimum 5 kts.Throughout the approach, the flight crew experienced moderate turbulence. The flight crew modified final approach speed (VAPP) was 148 kts (the flight crew added 2 kts the calculated VAPP of 146 kts).At 1000 ft, and at 500 ft Radio Height (RH), the first officer made calls on stabilized approach. The aircraft was configured for landing, with flap position 3, stabilized, and the autopilot engaged and the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode.At approximately 700 ft RH, the flight crew got visual contact with the runway. The Calibrated Air Speed (CAS) from 500 ft RH down to initial touchdown varied between approximately 160 kts CAS and 145 kts CAS. The aircraft remained stabilized on both localizer and glidepath down to 100 ft RH.On short final, the first officer informed the captain of a displayed crosswind of 36 kts. At approximately 190 ft RH, the captain disconnected the autopilot and flew the final approach manually with the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode.At 100 ft RH, the first officer made a standard operating call on aircraft pitch attitude: Pitch 2.5. From approximately 100 ft RH until 35 ft RH, the vertical speed increased from approximately 700 ft/minute (min) to approximately 1100 ft/min. At approximately 25 ft RH, the captain used an abrupt and progressive aft sidestick input and pulled back on the sidestick to full aft  deflection to stop the rate of descent.The synthetic voice calls TWENTY, RETARD and the initial touchdown occurred almost simultaneously. Before recorded activation of both main landing gear squat switches (weight on wheels - WOW), the captain advanced the thrust levers forward of the climb detent position. The aircraft made an initial touchdown at approximately 148 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 5.63°, a rate of decent of approximately 750 ft/min, and a vertical acceleration of 2.59 g. Upon initial touch down, the ground spoilers did not extend, and the autothrust deactivated. The aircraft lifted off the ground and up to 12 ft RH.During the bounce, the captain repeatedly voiced his surprise on the lack of flare. In the air, the engines spooled up, and the CAS increased to approximately 156 kts. Two synthetic voice calls on excessive pitch (PITCH), and one thrust lever retarding synthetic voice call (RETARD) sounded.The captain retarded the thrust levers to flight idle resulting in ground spoiler extension. The aircraft made a second touchdown at approximately 154 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 9.49° and a vertical acceleration of 2.56 g. The aircraft tail section struck the runway.Upon landing, neither of the pilots perceived that a tailstrike might have occurred, and the flight crew continued taxiing to the apron. During taxi to the apron, the captain briefed the passengers on the hard landing."
424,ACC2237,"The Beech 400A airplane, N750TA, collided with ground objects and terrain following a landing overrun on runway 24 at the Richmond Municipal Airport (RID), Indiana, USA. The three occupants were uninjured. The airplane sustained substantial wing and fuselage damage.After reviewing the weather at the destination airport the pilots decided they would be landing on runway 24 using the GPS approach. They reviewed weather at least ""4 or 5 times"" on the installed avionics display and the pilot stated that the displayed information indicated conditions of 1.5 miles visibility, ceiling of 1,500 ft, wind 090 at 4 knots, with fog and mist. The crew discussed the approach and talked about having a 4 knot quartering tailwind. When the airplane was near Richmond, the first officer listened to the automated weather observing system recording and it was reporting 3/4 mile visibility and 1,500 ft ceiling, scattered 300, wind 090 at 4 knots, temp 0C, dew point 0 C, altimeter 30.13 inches of mercury. The pilot indicated, ""All this information said we had the numbers to make the approach to runway 24, (5,500 feet long).""The pilot used the autopilot fly the approach to just before minimums. The airplane was about ""300 ft"" and the first officer called the runway to the left. The pilot looked up and saw the precision approach path indicator lights to the left and the runway straight ahead. However, the runway appeared to have a ""very light coating of snow on it."" The pilot elected to land and apply full thrust reverse and braking. The pilot also queried the first officer about the spoilers and the first officer confirmed the spoilers were out. A few seconds later the pilot felt the airplane was not slowing much and advised the first officer that the airplane was going to go off the end. At that point, the first officer said that he saw the 2,000 ft marker ahead of the airplane. Both pilots were pushing the brakes as hard as they could and full reverse was applied. The airplane went off the end of the runway and ended up across a road near the runway."
425,ACC2238,"A Cessna 208B aircraft operated by Amik Aviation, was conducting a VFR flight from Winnipeg/St. Andrews (CYAV), MB to Little Grand Rapids with 1 pilot and 6 passengers on board. Throughout the 133 nautical mile flight, the aircraft encountered a number of snow squalls, which reduced the flight visibility to approximately 3 nm. The pilot elected to continue the flight through these areas of snow squalls.As the aircraft approached Little Grand Rapids from the south, the pilot had the airport environment in sight and manoeuvred the aircraft to join a 3 nm final approach and descent for runway 36. When the aircraft was approximately 1.75 nm (3,24 km) from the threshold of runway 36, it encountered another snow squall, which reduced the flight visibility to less than 1 nm (1,85 km). The aircraft continued the descent in reduced visibility over the snow-covered frozen surface of Family Lake.At approximately 14:14, the pilot made the decision to initiate a go-around; however, as power was being applied, the aircraft collided with the frozen surface of Family Lake, 0.75 nm (1,39 km) from the threshold of runway 36. The aircraft remained upright and slid to a stop on the snow. The pilot and passengers egressed the aircraft, and were transported to the Little Grand Rapids nursing station for evaluation. The pilot suffered minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage."

The tow bar disconnected from the nose landing gear, and the aircraft rolled forward and struckthe tug."
427,ACC2240,"A Beechcraft B200 medevac aircraft operated by Keewatin Air, was conducting positioning flight KEW202 from Winnipeg/James Armstrong Richardson Intl (CYWG), MB to Churchill (CYYQ), MB with 2 flight crew and 2 flight nurses on board. A captain in training assumed the role of pilot-in-command (PIC) and Piot Flying while the line indoctrination captain acted as first officer (FO) and Pilot Monitoring on the flight.The FO conducted a pre-flight inspection of the aircraft and noted that the aircraft had about 1600 pounds of fuel on board. Because he preferred to order fuel directly from a fuel technician, he went to the fuel office in the hangar, but could not find anyone to take the fuel order. Intending to return to the office later, he went to the lounge where he found out that the flight would be delayed pending the arrival of the 2nd flight nurse. When the captain asked if the aircraft was ready for the flight, the FO replied that it was.When preparing for departure, the flight crew completed the BEFORE START checklist. The last step on the checklist was to start the engine. The flight crew then taxied to a run-up area and began the AFTER START checklist. When the FO read out the checklist item FUEL QUANTITY, the captain responded with the text that was printed on the checklist, ""SUFFICIENT/BALANCED,"" but he did not check the fuel quantity indicators. When the checklist was complete, the crew taxied to the runway. The aircraft departed CYWG at 16:39.Roughly 8 NM after the takeoff, while still in the climb, the captain performed a progressive fuel calculation. He did not look at the fuel quantity indicators during the process. The aircraft continued the climb and levelled off at flight level (FL) 250. During the rest of the flight, neither pilot performed periodic scans of the fuel quantity indicators.At 18:13, when the aircraft was about 14 NM west-northwest of Gillam Airport (CYGX) and still level at FL 250, the left fuel pressure (L FUEL PRESS) warning light illuminated, indicating low fuel. The warning was followed almost immediately by power surging in the left engine. The captain turned the boost pump ON, and noticed that the fuel quantity indicators were showing 0 pounds. The captain asked the FO about the fuel quantity, at which point the FO realized that he had forgotten to order fuel. The flight crew declared an emergency with the Winnipeg Area Control Centre (ACC) at 18:14 and began an emergency descent. The weather conditions at CYYQ were marginal, so the decision was made to divert to the alternate aerodrome, CYGX; however, the aircraft continued on the same heading toward CYYQ for another 2 minutesBy 18:15, when the aircraft was at FL 220, the left engine had exhausted its fuel supply and lost power. The crew conducted the emergency engine shutdown procedure in the Emergency and Abnormal Procedures Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) to shut down the engine; however, the left propeller continued to windmill at speeds between 1300 and 2000 rpm throughout the ensuing descent. At 18:15:32, the FO programmed the FMS to display a track to CYGX and instructed the captain to turn right and follow the track. The FO moved the heading bugs, which were coupled on both FMS displays, to the CYGX heading. The captain then initiated a right turn toward CYGX.The captain reduced the power setting of the right engine. From 18:15 to 18:18, the rate of descent varied between 3000 and 6000 fpm. The crew extended the landing gear in an attempt to set up a suitable descent angle to Runway 23. At 18:17, the flight crew informed the ACC that the nature of the emergency was fuel related. The ACC provided the flight crew with the weather at CYGX and informed them that emergency services at CYGX would be notified. As the aircraft descended through approximately 5000 feet above sea level (ASL), the FO obtained a vertical navigation (VNAV) profile to Runway 23 on the FMS. The crew retracted the landing gear as the aircraft intercepted the VNAV path. By 18:20, the airspeed had decayed to approximately 100 knots and the captain was having difficulty controlling the aircraft. At times, the aircraft was descending below the VNAV path. Seeing this, the FO took over control and assumed the Pilot Flying duties. At 18:21, as the aircraft descended through 2800 feet ASL, the left propeller ceased windmilling as the rpm decreased from 1300 to 0 rpm. The flight crew made a Mayday call at 18:21:30 on the CYGX mandatory frequency. When the aircraft was at approximately 2000 feet ASL, it descended below the cloud base and the FO was able to visually identify CYGX.At 18:22:34, when the aircraft was at 1300 feet ASL, roughly 835 feet above ground level (AGL), the right engine lost power. The aircraft could no longer maintain the VNAV path or a suitable visual approach to the runway. When the aircraft was at about 530 feet AGL and 1 NM from the runway, the crew shut down and feathered the right engine while continuing the right-hand curving visual approach to Runway 23.The flaps remained up throughout the approach and subsequent landing. The crew selected the landing gear DOWN when the aircraft was at about 50 feet AGL and the aircraft touched down on the frozen surface of Stephens Lake with the landing gear fully extended.Sufficient airspeed remained to enable the FO to raise the nose as the aircraft approached the rocky shoreline at the approach end of Runway 23. The aircraft struck the rocky shoreline in a nose-high attitude and skidded up onto the right edge of the runway area, coming to rest approximately 190 feet before the threshold ."
428,ACC2241,"The Douglas DC-3C aircraft operated by Buffalo Airways, was conducting cargo flight 169 from Hay River (CYHY) to Yellowknife (CYZF), Canada, with 2 flight crew on board. After departure, while the aircraft was climbing through 1200 feet above sea level on the way to a cruising altitude of 5000 feet, the flight crew completed the after-takeoff checklist and applied carburetor heat to 20 °C. While the First Officer (FO) was applying the carburetor heat, oil pressure was observed decreasing on the left engine (Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92). Moments later, rising cylinder head temperature and oil temperature indications were also observed on the left engine. The captain directed the FO to contact the area control centre to declare a PAN PAN emergency and request a return to CYHY, which the FO then did. The aircraft flight manual (AFM) does not contain any procedures for abnormal engine indications.As the aircraft reached an altitude of 1969 feet, the captain set the left engine to a reduced power setting and increased the power on the right engine to maximum except takeoff (METO) power. The flight crew began to set up for an instrument landing system approach to CYHY via TANPO.At 07:47, while the aircraft was in a right turn proceeding towards TANPO, smoke and oil were observed, and abnormal sounds were heard coming from the left engine. Using the engine failure checklist, the flight crew then shut down the left engine and feathered the propeller. At 07:48, because the situation had escalated, a MAYDAY emergency was declared. Moments later, the flight crew completed the descent checklist and initiated the approach checklist. However, due to the escalating emergency, the flight crew was not able to complete the approach checklist, which included the landing briefing.At 07:53, the aircraft levelled off at 1214 feet. The FO observed zero hydraulic pressure on the landing gear DOWN gauge. Thinking this zero pressure was an issue, he mentioned it to the captain, who then directed the FO to ""prep the gear."" The FO extended the landing gear, which the captain did not expect because the aircraft had not started its final approach and the airport had not been visually acquired.At 07:55, as the aircraft continued towards TANPO, the altitude was between 1200 and 1300 feet ASL, and the airspeed was maintained at approximately 100 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). When the aircraft was abeam TANPO, the captain began a right turn to intercept the localizer for the final approach. The aircrafts airspeed decreased from 100 KIAS to 80 KIAS, while its altitude decreased to 1100 feet ASL. With the reduced airspeed, the aircrafts flight control response became sluggish and the captain directed the landing gear to be raised.After the landing gear was raised, at 07:59, the flight crew heard abnormal sounds and felt vibrations from the right engine. The aircrafts airspeed was 80 KIAS, and its altitude began to decrease to below 800 feet ASL.  In an attempt to maintain altitude, the right engine was increased to maximum takeoff power, but this had no effect. The flight crew then prepared for an emergency gear-up landing, and the aircrafts flaps were lowered on short final to reduce speed for touchdown.At 08:01, the aircraft landed in muskeg on KatlOdeeche First Nation land, approximately 3.5 nautical miles southeast of CYHY. After the aircraft came to a stop, the FO exited the aircraft through the right-hand crew window, while the captain remained in the cockpit to secure the right engine and aircraft systems before evacuating via the forward door. The FO contacted the flight information centre to notify them of the crews status and aircraft location. The emergency locator transmitter had not activated during the forced landing, so the FO activated it manually to assist search and rescue in locating the aircraft. The flight crew was uninjured. The aircraft received substantial damage. There was no post-impact fire. First responders arrived at the accident site at 11:14"
429,ACC2242,"A Miami Air Boeing 737-800, registration N732MA, operating as Flight 293 from Cubas Leeward Point Field at Guantánamo Bay experienced a runway overrun upon landing at Jacksonville Naval Air Station/Towers Field (KNIP), Florida. The airplane came to rest in the shallow waters of St. Johns River, sustaining substantial damage. The 143 passengers and crew survived.The aircraft was engaged in a charter flight to bring military personnel and family members home. The No. 1 (left) thrust reverser was not operational and deferred for the flight in accordance with the airplanes minimum equipment list. The captain was the pilot flying for the accident flight, and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The captain was also performing check airman duties for the first officer who was in the process of completing operating experience training.Flight 293 departed Guantánamo Bay at 23:19 UTC.At 21:22 local time the pilot checked in with a Jacksonville approach (JAX) controller while level at 13,000 ft mean sea level and was provided the JAX altimeter setting; the controller advised the pilot to expect the RNAV runway 28 approach and moderate-to-heavy precipitation on the final approach to runway 28 (9000 ft/2743 m long).At 21:23, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the winds at KNIP were from 350° at 4 knots; the pilot then asked if there was any chance of getting runway 10 because it looked a little better. The JAX controller responded that he was showing moderate-to-heavy precipitation building over runway 10 starting about 5 miles on final. The pilot acknowledged and said he would stick with runway 28.  He was then instructed to descend and maintain 5,000 ft.At 21:25, the controller provided additional weather information to the flight crew, stating that moderate-to-heavy precipitation was present east and west of the airport. The pilot elected to continue for an approach to runway 28.At 21:30, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the flight was heading northbound and the precipitation was moving eastbound; the controller then asked the pilot if he would like to try runway 10 since it might be better. The pilot acknowledged ""yeah go ahead, lets do it."" The controller then instructed the pilot to turn left to a heading of 270°, and the pilot acknowledged.  Over the next several minutes, the flight was vectored for the approach to runway 10. At 21:37, the JAX controller cleared the flight for the RNAV runway 10 approach, and the pilot acknowledged.  Shortly after, the flight was transferred to the KNIP radar controller.The pilot contacted the KNIP radar controller, and, at 21:39, the KNIP radar controller indicated the winds were from 240° at 10 knots; he then cleared the flight to land on runway 10. As the airplane descended through 1,390 ft mean sea level (msl), the pilots configured it for landing with the flaps set at 30° and the landing gear extended; however, the speedbrake handle was not placed in the armed position as specified in the Landing checklist. At an altitude of about 1,100 ft msl and 2.8 nm from the runway, the airplane was slightly above the glidepath, and its airspeed was on target. Over the next minute, the indicated airspeed increased to 170 knots (17 knots above the target approach speed), and groundspeed reached 180 knots, including an estimated 7-knot tailwind.At an altitude of about 680 ft msl and 1.6 nm from the threshold, the airplane deviated further above the 3° glidepath such that the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights would have appeared to the flight crew as four white lights and would retain that appearance throughout the rest of the approach. Eight seconds before touchdown, multiple enhanced ground proximity warning system alerts announced ""sink rate"" as the airplanes descent rate peaked at 1,580 fpm. The airplane crossed the displaced threshold 120 ft above the runway and 17 knots above the target approach speed, with a groundspeed of 180 knots and a rate of descent about 1,450 ft per minute (fpm). The airplane touched down about 1,580 ft beyond the displaced threshold, which was 80 ft beyond the designated touchdown zone as specified in the operators standard operating procedures (SOP).After touchdown, the captain deployed the No. 2 engine thrust reverser and began braking; he later reported, however, that he did not feel the aircraft decelerate and increased the brake pressure. The speedbrakes deployed about 4 seconds after touchdown, most likely triggered by the movement of the right throttle into the idle reverse thrust detent after main gear tire spinup.The automatic deployment of the speedbrakes was likely delayed by about 3 seconds compared to the automatic deployment that could have been obtained by arming the speedbrakes before landing. The airplane crossed the end of the runway about 55 ft right of the centerline and impacted a seawall 90 ft to the right of the centerline, 9,170 ft beyond the displaced threshold, and 1,164 ft beyond the departure end of runway 10. After the airplane came to rest in St. Johns River, the flight crew began an emergency evacuation.The airplane was mostly intact, but both main landing gear had separated from the airplane and were also located in the river."
430,ACC2243,"An Antonov An-2R sustained substantial damage in an accident near Uriman Airport in Venezuela. The aircraft was carrying livestock when the engine began to suffer from vibrations. The engine lost power, and the pilots had to carry out a forced landing.  The aircraft crashed next to a group of trees, severing both left-hand wings. The aircraft came to rest inverted."
431,ACC2244,"A float-equipped DHC-3 Turbine Otter (N959PA of Taquan Air) and a float-equipped DHC-2 Beaver (N952DB of Mountain Air Service) collided in midair, about 7 miles northeast of Ketchikan, Alaska, USA. The five occupants of the DHC-2 sustained fatal injuries. The DHC-3 pilot sustained minor injuries, nine passengers sustained serious injuries, and one passenger sustained fatal injuries. The purpose of both flights was to transport passengers to Ketchikan from the Misty Fjords National Monument area in Alaska, USA. Both flights were converging on a scenic waterfall before returning to the Ketchikan Harbor Seaplane Base.At 12:17:15, the DHC-3 was about level at 4,000 ft mean sea level (msl) on a track of 225°, and the DHC-2 was 4.2 nautical miles south of the DHC-3, climbing through 2,800 ft msl, on a track of 255°. About 12:19, the DHC-3 started a descent from 4,000 ft msl, and the DHC-2 was at 3,175 ft msl and climbing. During the next 1 minute 21 seconds, the DHC-3 continued to descend on a track between 224° and 237°, and the DHC-2 leveled out at 3,350 ft msl on a track of about 255°. The airplanes collided at 12:21:14 at an altitude of 3,350 ft msl, 7.4 nm northeast of Ketchikan Harbor.The DHC-3 pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight from the Misty Fjords area had proceeded normally, and he had descended and was maneuvering the airplane to show passengers a waterfall near Mahoney Lake when the collision occurred. Just prior to the collision, he saw a flash from his left side, and experienced a large, loud impact. According to the pilot, the DHC-3 airplane then rolled right and pitched about 40 degrees nose down toward the water in George Inlet. The pilot stated that he was able to maintain some control and flare the airplane prior to impact. The pilot, some passengers, and some bystanders helped the passengers of the DHC-3 evacuate the airplane and move to the shore. The DHC-3 main wreckage came to rest about 80 ft underwater about 400 ft off the east shore of George Inlet.The DHC-2 airplane broke up in-flight after the collision, and the wreckage was scattered over water and mountainous tree-covered terrain northeast of Mahoney Lake on the west shore of George Inlet.Both aircraft were ADS-B-equipped and both pilots were presented with visual traffic information through the iPad with ForeFlight app (DHC-2) and Chelton display (DHC-3). However, the Garmin GSL 71 on the DHC-3 had been turned off, causing pressure altitude of the airplane not to be transmitted with the ADS-B data. Thus, both systems were not able to generate warnings of potential conflicts.Additionally, the DHC-2 was obscured from the Otter pilot's vision by the window frame until the very last moment. The Beaver pilot likely was unable to see the Otter approaching from behind due to the aircraft structure and the passenger seated on his right."
432,ACC2245,"An Antonov An-2R, RA-81519, sustained substantial damage in a forced landing in a forest. The copilot was injured.The aircraft was engaged in aerial application flights out of Kyren to protect forests from the Siberian silkworm.

The aircraft came down at an elevation of 1416 m."
433,ACC2246,"The Basler BT-67 aircraft operated by North Star Air, was conducting a series of flights between Pickle Lake Airport (CYPL), Ontario, and Fort Hope Airport (CYFH), Ontario, Canada.The purpose of the flights was to deliver 5940 L of diesel fuel per trip to the Eabametoong First Nation community, also known as Fort Hope. Before departing CYFH on the occurrence flight, the crew conducted the before-takeoff checklist, which requires the propeller automatic feathering system to be armed for takeoff; however, the crew did not arm this system.At approximately 01:40, the aircraft departed CYFH with the first officer acting as the pilot flying (PF), seated in the right seat, and the captain acting as the pilot not flying (PNF), seated in the left seat. Shortly after takeoff, the PF called for the landing gear to be retracted. The PNF then selected the gear up at approximately 200 feet above ground level (AGL). Both engines subsequently lost power simultaneously, and the flight crew executed a forced landing on Eabamet Lake, Ontario, in total darkness.The aircraft fuselage remained intact and immediately began to fill with water. The flight crew retrieved the survival kit, evacuated the aircraft via the main cabin door, and swam to shore.Once on shore, the flight crew started a fire to warm up. The fire was noticed by a patrolling officer of the Nishnawbe Aski Police Service, who responded and transported the flight crew to the nursing station at the Eabametoong First Nation Band Office for a medical assessment. Neither flight crew member was injured.The aircraft sustained substantial damage, but there was no post-impact fire. The aircraft remained floating in the water."

436,ACC2249,"Grant Aviation flight 262, a Cessna 208B airplane, N9448B, was destroyed by a post-crash fire after impacting terrain during a go-around maneuver at Bethel Airport, Alaska. The pilot and five passengers sustained minor injuries. The pilot stated that after contacting the Bethel Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) about 10 miles west of the airport, he offered to use runway 12, because it was a more expeditious arrival from the west, and he wanted to ""make it easier"" for the tower controller who was very busy with arrivals of other airplanes using runways 1L and 1R. The pilot reported that, about 4 miles southwest of the airport, the tower controller cleared him to land on runway 12. Shortly thereafter, the tower controller asked the pilot to ""square off"" his approach. The pilot stated that he selected a higher than normal traffic pattern altitude, due to the limited visibility and terrain located on the west side of the airport. He conducted a visual approach to runway 12, with an increased rate of descent and full flaps. During the landing flare, the airplane floated down the runway, and the pilot executed a go-around, due to insufficient runway distance remaining. He advanced the throttle to maximum (red line), and retracted the flaps to 20°, while increasing the airplane's pitch attitude. As the airplane climbed out, the pilot transmitted on the tower frequency that he was going around. The pilot recalled that the tower controller urgently instructed him twice to ""turn left immediately."" He said that as he initiated the turn to the left, the airplane suddenly stalled, rolled right and descended, impacting the ground in a right wing low attitude. The airplane came to rest on its right side in the grass covered drainage ditch between runways 1L and 1R. The pilot stated that he saw fire through the right window, and immediately went to the back of the airplane to help with the evacuation of the two children and three adult passengers through the left cargo door before the airplane was consumed by fire."

438,ACC2251,"At 16:18 on local time, a WestJet Encore DHC-8-402 aircraft operating as scheduled flight 3362, departed Fort McMurray Airport (CYMM), Canada, on a domestic flight bound for Edmonton International Airport (CYEG). The captain was the pilot flying (PF) and the first officer was the pilot monitoring (PM). After departure, the aircraft climbed to a cruising altitude of flight level 240. During the flight, the landing runway was changed from runway 30 to runway 20, and finally to runway 12 because of the weather at CYEG, which included a thunderstorm in the area. Once on final approach for runway 12, the flight crew was cleared for a visual approach. The PF planned for and briefed the PM on a flap 15 landing with a VREF speed of 122 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS).During the approach phase, the PF added 20 knots to the VREF speed in anticipation of a missed approach, which would involve flying in close proximity to the approaching thunderstorm and possible wind shear. A firm landing was planned due to the potentially gusty conditions on the ground.When the aircraft was 3 nautical miles from CYEG, in level flight at 5000 feet above sea level, the flaps were set to 15°, the landing gear was lowered and the aircrafts airspeed was 142 KIAS, which was the planned VREF speed plus the added 20 knots.At 17:13, the aircraft touched down on the main landing gear within the touchdown zone at a speed of 142 KIAS. Shortly after the initial touchdown, the aircrafts weight on wheels sensor indicated that the aircraft had briefly returned to air mode. The PF then made a full nose-down elevator input. A bang and a nose-wheel shimmy followed, and the aircraft pulled to the left as it rolled out on the runway.After landing, the crew consulted the aircrafts integrated communication and application system, and no hard landing indications were noted. The flight crew then taxied the aircraft off runway 12 and onto taxiway A2. Concerned that the aircraft had been damaged during the landing, the flight crew then stopped and requested assistance from maintenance.Due to lightning activity near the airport, shortly after the aircraft had landed, the CYEG duty manager issued a red alert, restricting ground handlers and maintenance personnel from accessing the airfield. Approximately 45 minutes later, the red alert was cancelled and WestJet Encore maintenance personnel attended to the occurrence aircraft. After a brief damage assessment, both nose landing gear tires were changed and the flight crew taxied the aircraft to the terminal gate to disembark the passengers.There were no reported injuries.Given the gusty wind conditions on approach, normal procedures in the WestJet Encore Aircraft Operating Manual called for a target speed of VREF +5 knots, plus half of the gust of 15 knots, or a total of VREF +13 knots. Procedures also called for this speed to be reduced once over the threshold to achieve VREF at touchdown. However, the flight crew planned and flew the approach at VREF +20 knots. The airspeed was not reduced as the aircraft approached the runway threshold and the aircraft touched down at this airspeed."
439,ACC2252,"Seair Seaplanes was contracted by a remote fishing lodge on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada to provide seasonal transport of guests and supplies between Vancouver International Water Airport (CAM9), BC, and the lodge, which is located about 66 nautical miles north-northwest of Port Hardy Airport (CYZT), BC.On the morning of the occurrence, four Seair visual flight rules (VFR) flights were scheduled to fly to the central coast of BC, all on float-equipped Cessna Caravan aircraft. The first 3 flights were direct flights to the fishing lodge. Because of poor weather conditions in the central coast region, however, all of the flights were delayed.After the crews referred to weather cameras along the central coast region, the flights began to depart, but in a different order than originally scheduled. One of Seairs senior operational staff (operations manager) departed CAM9 at 08:50 aboard C-FLAC. The occurrence aircraft departed at 09:32.The pilot originally scheduled to fly C-GSAS declined the flight. This pilot had recently upgraded to the Caravan, had never flown to this destination before, and was concerned about the weather at the destination. When Seairs chief pilot returned to CAM9 at 09:53 after a series of scheduled flights on a different type of aircraft, he assumed the last remaining flight to the lodge and C-GSAS departed CAM9 at 10:24.After departing the Vancouver terminal control area, the occurrence aircraft climbed to 4500 feet above sea level (ASL) and remained at this altitude until 10:23, when a slow descent was initiated. The aircraft levelled off at approximately 1300 feet ASL at 10:44, when it was approximately 18 NM northeast of Port Hardy Airport (CYZT), BC, and 57 NM southeast of the destination.At 10:50, the occurrence aircraft slowly descended again as the flight continued northbound. During this descent, the aircrafts flaps were extended to the 10° position. At this point, the occurrence aircraft was 37 NM south-southeast of the fishing lodge. The aircraft continued to descend until it reached an altitude of approximately 330 feet ASL, at 10:56. By this point, the occurrence aircraft was being operated along the coastline, but over the ocean.C-FLAC departed from the fishing lodge at 10:56 on the return flight to CAM9. C-FLAC flew into the Fitz Hugh Sound and proceeded southbound along the western shoreline. At approximately 11:00, it flew through an area of heavy rain where visibility was reduced to about 1 statute mile (SM). C-FLAC descended to about 170 feet ASL and maintained this altitude for the next 5 minutes before climbing to about 300 feet ASL.As the southbound C-FLAC entered Fitz Hugh Sound from the north at Hecate Island, the occurrence aircraft entered Fitz Hugh Sound from the south, near the southern tip of Calvert Island. The occurrence aircraft then changed course from the western to the eastern shoreline, and descended again to about 230 feet ASL, while maintaining an airspeed of approximately 125 knots.The two aircraft established 2-way radio contact. The pilot of C-FLAC indicated that Addenbroke Island was visible when he flew past it, and described the weather conditions in the Fitz Hugh Sound to the occurrence pilot as heavy rain showers and visibility of approximately 1 SM around Kelpie Point. The occurrence pilot then indicated that he would maintain a course along the eastern shoreline of the sound.At 11:03, the two aircraft were separated by 2 NM and passed each other on reciprocal tracks, approximately 4 NM south of the accident site. The occurrence aircraft maintained a consistent track and altitude for the next 54 seconds, then slowly began a 25° change in track to the west (0.35 NM from the Addenbroke Island shoreline). Seven seconds after the turn started (0.12 NM from the islands shoreline), the aircraft entered a shallow climb averaging 665 fpm.At 11:04:55, the occurrence aircraft struck trees on Addenbroke Island at an altitude of approximately 490 feet ASL, at an airspeed of 114 knots, and in a relatively straight and level attitude. The aircraft then continued through the heavily forested hillside for approximately 450 feet, coming to rest at an elevation of 425 feet ASL, 9.7 NM east-southeast of the destination fishing lodge.The aircraft was destroyed by the impact forces and the pilot and three of the eight passengers were killed."

During the pre-flight checks, the flight crew did not identify that there was no pressure in the braking system and did not pressurise this system prior to engine start.Around the time of the start of the final engine in the starting sequence, the aircraft began to roll forward.The dispatcher noticed the aircraft rolling and alerted the crew. The crew attempted to use their foot brakes and the park-brake, however, there was no brake pressure. Around 18 seconds after the aircraft started to roll, it  collided with movable aircraft stairs, which were in front of the Cobham terminal. The stairs struck the front of the aircraft, beneath the right pilot seat. Shortly after, NJW collided with a bollard in front of a light pole, then with the light pole itself."
442,ACC2255,"Everts Air Cargo Flight 25, a Douglas C-118A Liftmaster, N451CE, was substantially damaged when it struck a berm and damaged the landing gear while inbound to land in Candle, Alaska. There were no injures to the three crew members onboard.According to the captain, after overflying AK75 they entered the traffic pattern to land on runway 20. He stated that the approach was steeper than normal due to terrain; however, the sight picture indicated touchdown near the threshold of the 3,880 ft runway. A bump was felt near the threshold during the landing but was not extreme. The airplane's propellers were then put into reverse and the airplane veered to the right. The flight engineer applied asymmetric reverse, in an effort, to correct for the right turning tendency, and the airplane tracked straight for about 2,000 ft before it veered sharply to the right, exited the runway and spun 180. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. An inspection of the threshold of runway 20 revealed several 4 ft tall piles of rocks and dirt."

First a return flight to Rackla Airstrip, then a return flight to Rau Airstrip. The pilot completed the first two flights with no issues. The aircraft departed CYMA on the third flight at 09:54. A portion of the recorded track was along Granite Creek at an altitude of 4200 feet ASL, which put the aircraft 100 to 200 feet above ground level (AGL) at the highest point along Granite Creek. The aircraft was observed flying eastbound along Granite Creek at low altitude and in reduced visibilities due to rain and cloud at about 10:05. The aircraft arrived at Rau Airstrip at 10:17, where the cargo was unloaded and different cargo loaded. A passenger boarded the aircraft for the final flight and was seated in the right seat in the cockpit. The aircraft departed Rau Airstrip at 11:01.The route of the fourth flight from Rau to CYMA was the reverse of the previous flight. The aircraft entered Granite Creek at 4300 feet ASL and was flying at a ground speed of 156 knots.Eyewitnesses at an exploration camp approximately halfway along Granite Creek heard and then observed the aircraft flying at near tree-top level. The cloud bases to the west of the exploration camp were at tree-top level.As it passed the exploration camp, the aircraft turned south into a box canyon, departing from the intended route. It headed toward rising terrain that led to the north face of Mount Albert. The aircraft began to climb and shortly thereafter was observed to disappear into the clouds and fog at 11:12. The aircraft impacted terrain approximately 30 seconds later, in a near wings-level attitude with the flaps in the up position. The 2 occupants were fatally injured on impact.

The airline transport pilot, flight instructor, and a passenger observer received minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The airline transport pilot, seated in the left seat pilot, was receiving company training and was the flying pilot during the accident flight.The left seat pilot stated they were practicing an ILS approach for landing with a full stop on runway 13. The airplane was configured with 20° of wing flaps for landing. He said the airplane was above the glidepath, and he transitioned his scan from the flight instruments to the outside visual environment. He lowered the nose when the airplane was about 100 ft above ground level and noted the airplane was slightly left of runway centerline. He attempted to align the airplane with the centerline and thought the airplane was getting fast, so he increased the airplane pitch attitude about 50 ft above ground level.The airplane was still high when it crossed over the runway numbers and the descent rate increased. He said the flight instructor called for a go-around at the same time he decided to initiate a go-around. The left seat pilot said he attempted to add airplane energy with forward control input, which cause the airplane to pitch down with not a lot of airspeed or altitude. The left seat pilot started to increase backpressure on the flight controls and add engine power but the airplane continued to descend into the ground. The airplane struck the ground in a nose down attitude and then veered off of the runway to the left, coming to rest in the grass. The left wing and fuselage sustained substantial damage."

451,ACC2264,"A Cessna 560XL Citation Excel suffered a runway excursion after an aborted takeoff at Oroville Airport, California, USA. A fire broke out in the grass besides the aircraft. After all ten occupants had evacuated the aircraft, the fire spread and engulfed the aircraft.The pilot flying reported to the NTSB that prior to takeoff, they had a waypoint fix and departure change, which he updated within the flight management system. After some four minutes they taxied onto runway 2 and the captain called for the before takeoff checklist. Following completion of the checklist, they initiated takeoff, and the non-flying pilot called ""airspeed alive,"" V1, and Vr. The pilot flying pulled the yoke back but the airplane didn't lift off. A second attempt had no effect. Shortly after, the non-flying pilot called for an abort, and the pilot flying applied full thrust reversers and maximum braking. Subsequently, the airplane exited the departure end of the runway, impacted a ditch, and skidded across a grass covered area, where the post impact fire ensued.Examination of the runway revealed tire transfer marks which originated from the runway 2 hold short line and progressed onto the runway, and continued throughout the entire length of the runway, overrun, adjacent runway, grassy area, taxiway, and grassy area near the main wreckage."
452,ACC2265,"A Lockheed C-130A, N119TG experienced multiple system failures shortly after takeoff from Santa Maria Public Airport, California, USA. The pilot made an emergency landing at the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, California. The airplane sustained substantial damage and fire damage from a postcrash fire. The seven people onboard were not injured. According to the operator, the airplane was stationed in Malaysia in order to respond to emergencies in the area. It was scheduled for a maintenance C-check and was en route to International Air Responses home base at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. The flight had made a refueling stop in Hilo, Hawaii, and another refueling stop in Santa Maria. During those legs of the flight, no problems had been encountered.Prior to takeoff they requested an IFR clearance to visual flight rules (VFR) on top. After they departed from Santa Maria, they contacted Santa Barbara controllers and cancelled their IFR as soon as they broke out of the clouds. Shortly after cancelling IFR, the flight crew heard a loud popping noise, and the passengers heard a loud bang. Simultaneously, the torque gages provided unusual and fluctuating readings. A crew member in the cargo compartment announced misting hydraulic fluid mixed with smoke. The flight crew saw fire-warning lights and other anomalies. The passengers donned their supplemental oxygen and the cockpit crew turned off the four engine bleeds. At this time, they also noticed the utility hydraulic pressure fluctuating and a crew member advised that the landing gear should be lowered before there was a total utility system failure. The landing gear was lowered; the nose and left landing gear lowered, but the right landing gear took longer to lower. The cockpit crew observed three green lights from the landing gear, which indicated the landing gear was lowered and locked. The flight crew turned off the numbers 2 and 4 hydraulic pumps. As they continued to trouble shoot the multiple failures, they diverted to Santa Barbara based on weather considerations, they did not want to return to Santa Maria which would require an ILS approach.The captain declared an emergency and requested radar vectors for terrain clearance when he noticed that the airplane was yawing back and forth. The numbers 3 and 4 fire handles were illuminated, and the number 4 engine was feathered which stopped the yaw of the airplane. During the flight to Santa Barbara, they had to maneuver the airplane over terrain. Once they had cleared the terrain and had the airport in sight, they began their descent. He advised Santa Barbara tower that he would make S-turns to lose altitude as they had no flaps. As a result, their approach speed would be fast, and they would likely use the full length of the runway.As the airplane touched down, he applied full inboard reverse thrust as soon as the nose wheel touched down. The right wing began to drop and the airplane drifted to the right. He applied full left rudder and began using the No. 1 engine reverse to try and keep the airplane on the runway. The airplane continued to the right and departed the right side of the runway. The captain intentionally ground looped the airplane as it was continuing toward the main terminal and parked airplanes. The airplane came to a stop about 270-degrees right of the runway heading.Two Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors inspected the airplane and identified the number 3 bleed air duct had failed, which blew hot air onto the surrounding electrical wires and hydraulic lines."

The airplane was privately owned and operated as a skydiving flight.According to the pilot, he was flying 10 skydivers and one passenger up to an altitude of 10,500 feet mean sea level. After the skydivers departed the airplane, the pilot returned to the airport and made a normal approach to land on runway 24. When the airplane was about 10-15 feet above the runway, he thought he encountered a sudden downdraft and the airplane just ""dropped"" out of the air and landed hard on the grass runway. The nose landing gear fractured off as the airplane slid to the right side of the runway and crossed the asphalt parallel runway. The airplane then contacted a small tree on the right wing that spun the airplane around. The left wing then contacted the ground and bent the last three feet of the wing tip up.

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured.The flight originated from Naples Municipal Airport (APF), Naples, Florida at 19:53 and was destined for Kerrville Municipal Airport (ERV), Texas.The pilot in command reported that after a normal takeoff roll and rotation from Naples, during the initial climb and landing gear retraction, he observed a red warning light that the nose landing gear (NLG) remained in transit and was not fully retracted. He reported that a vibration and a ""thud"" were felt from the NLG section; at this time the main landing gear indicated that they were retracted. He further reported that they attempted to extend the landing gear via the checklist but were unable to get the NLG to indicate that it was down and locked, or retracted. Subsequently, the flight crew diverted to RSW due to the availability of a 12,000 ft dry runway; during the landing, the nose gear failed to extend, the airplane skidded to a stop on the runway, and the flight crew and passengers performed an emergency evacuation via the main cabin door. The fuselage sustained substantial damage.The NLG actuator push rod linkage was found to be disconnected from its attach point, the nut, bolt, and pin assembly was missing, and deformation in the area where the nut, bolt, and pin assembly should be installed was observed."
457,ACC2270,"A Let L-410 was involved in an accident near Bor. The aircraft came down 15 km from Bor. It was raining at the time of the accident.Photos from the accident show the aircraft having come to rest in an area with tall grass, shrubs and trees. The left-hand wing and horizontal stabilizer are bent upwards. The right-hand wing has separated at the engine. The nose section is demolished."
458,ACC2271,"Horizon Air as flight 2337, a DHC-8, N402QX, struck a bird during climb out from Boise Airport (KBOI), Idaho. After the collision, the flight crew saw visual evidence of the bird remains on the left wing, determined there were no indications of control problems, and decided to continue to Seattle/Tacoma International Airport (KSEA), Washington, where the flight landed with no further incident.  Postflight inspection of the airplane revealed that the the bird impact had partially severed the left wing leading edge composite structure and cracked the front spar web."
459,ACC2272,"A DHC-8-315 aircraft, operated by Surveillance Australia, was about to start the take-off roll from Darwin Airport, Australia, on a surveillance flight. There were four crew on board.The aircraft was on the departure runway with the brakes on. Power was applied to both engines, but when take-off power was reached, and prior to the release of the brakes, the crew heard a loud bang. In response, the captain aborted the take-off, reduced both power levers to flight idle, and instructed the FO to contact air traffic control (ATC) to advise they were aborting the take-off and had an engine issue. Air traffic control acknowledged the advice and reported sighting smoke from the right engine before informing emergency services. The captain checked the right engine instrumentation and advised the crew that the torque gauge had failed, and the propeller RPM gauge indicated zero. Other indications for the gas core of the engine, such as fuel flow, appeared normal. The captain instructed the FO to shut down the engine.After confirming the aircraft brake, hydraulic and electrical systems were functioning, the crew returned the aircraft to the maintenance hangar. A subsequent inspection of the runway by a safety car identified metal fragments behind the take-off position.The right engine was subsequently removed from the aircraft with an external inspection revealing that all of the second-stage power turbine (PT2) blades had separated from the disk. The PT assembly could not be rotated but the propeller shaft turned freely."
460,ACC2273,"A Busy Bee Congo  Dornier 228-200 aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from Goma, D.R. Congo. The aircraft crashed onto buildings in the Birere neighbourhood south of the airport and a fire erupted.Of the 20 passengers and two crew members on board, just one passenger survived. On the ground a family of six was killed. The air traffic controller reported that he noticed the wings were rocking shortly after the aircraft became airborne from runway 17. When climbing at a shallow angle, the flight contacted the controller, requesting a turn back to runway 35, without stating the nature of their emergency."
461,ACC2274,"A Beechcraft 99 suffered a runway excursion after landing on runway 12 at Black Point, Bahamas.On touchdown on the area preceding the useable portion of runway 11 at Black Point, the right main gear entered an area approximately 1-3 inches in depth. It subsequently struck an exposed section of asphalt (46 mm thick) on the unusable portion of the beginning of the runway.Given the speed of the aircraft at the time of the touch down the right main landing gear collapsed after striking the exposed surface. The disabled aircraft traveled an additional distance of approximately 1,527 ft down the runway before exiting the runway and coming to a stop approximately 20 feet in bushes lining the side of the runway.The aircraft sustained damages to the right wing, trailing and leading edges, right propeller, right main gear and fuselage. There were no injuries reported."
462,ACC2275,"The Basler BT-67 aircraft operated by North Star Air, collided with terrain approximately 500 metres southwest of the threshold of runway 10 of Sachigo Lake Airport, Ontario, Canada. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The 2 flight crew members received no injuries.The aircraft was operated on a daytime VFR cargo flight from Red Lake Airport (CYRL) to Sachigo Lake Airport (CZPB). No weather reports for the destination were available, but the captain learned that an airport 30 nm to the southeast reported IMC conditions with an overcast ceiling at 500 feet AGL, with an expected improval to 1500 feet AGL with a possible fluctuation to 700 feet AGL and decreased visibility by 09:00. The flight departed CYRL under visual flight rules (VFR) at 08:00. Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft entered, and climbed above, the cloud layers before reaching the planned cruising altitude, which was not in accordance with the applicable regulations for VFR flights. Before commencing the descent to CZPB, the pilots obtained the 08:00 hourly weather report at at the nearby airport, which had remained generally unchanged, and elected to carry out a visual approach to runway 10. The captain initiated a descent through the cloud layers by reference to the flight instruments.Once the aircraft broke out of cloud at very low level, the aircraft was not in a position to continue with the planned visual approach. The captain made low-level manoeuvres in an attempt to land, flying a large 360° turn, as low as 100 feet AGL (i.e. about 400 feet below the required minimum altitude), and then flew a manoeuvre similar to a left-hand circuit, which brought the aircraft within close proximity to a significant obstacle (a 150-foot tall tower), in meteorological conditions below the VFR minimum requirements. Given that the captain had not briefed the first officer, the latter was unaware of the captains intentions and began calling out airspeed and altitudes. On the last attempt, during the low-level downwind leg, when the aircraft passed abeam the threshold of runway 10, the captain initiated a left-hand turn and began descending. About 10 seconds later, the aircraft collided with terrain, in a near wings-level attitude, approximately 650 feet southwest of the threshold of runway 10. The aircraft slid 350 feet southward along the ground before it came to a rest on a southwesterly heading.The captain likely experienced attentional narrowing while carrying out a high-workload visual approach at very low altitude in IMC. This most likely resulted in an inadvertent but controlled descent that was not detected until the aircraft collided with terrain.The uninjured pilots evacuated the aircraft via the right-hand cockpit window. The aircraft sustained substantial damage; however, there was no post-impact fire."
463,ACC2276,"Bek Air flight 2100, a Fokker 100, crashed into a building during takeoff from Almaty Airport, Kazakhstan. The aircraft was operating a scheduled domestic service to Nursultan. The captain was Pilot Flying. Air temperature was -12°C and prior to departure the horizontal stabilizer was de-iced; the wings were not de-iced. Flaps were set at 0° and the aircraft commenced the takeoff roll from runway 05R at 07:20 local time.The aircraft took off at 07:20:36 at a speed of 148 knots. Immediately after the separation of the aircraft from the runway, it rolled from 5° right to 19° to the left without an increase in indicated airspeed and with an increase in pitch angle to 14°.At 07:20:42, gaining a height of 20 feet (6 meters), the aircraft lost altitude and the IAS decreased to 130 knots as it rolled from 14° to the right to 11° to the left.At 07:20:50, the plane contacted the runway with its tail and landed on the main landing gear. The aircraft ran along the runway for 15 seconds with the nose gear raised, without a significant increase in speed.The aircraft became airborne again at a speed of 138 knots with the tail touching the runway. The crew retracted the landing gear. The aircraft again rolled from left to right with the pitch angle increasing to 19°. The IAS decreased to 130 knots and at 07:21:09, after gaining a height of 11 feet (3.3 meters), the aircraft banked right, descended and slid over the ground until it went through the airport perimeter fence. At 07:21:12, at a speed of 147 knots, the aircraft collided with a house.The Vice-Minister of Health reported that 12 occupants had died and 47 were injured, of which 8 in extremely serious condition."
464,ACC2277,"A Let L-410 suffered a runway excursion while landing on the wet gravel airstrip of Kamina Airport in D.R. Congo.The aircraft swung to the right and went off the runway. The nose landing gear collapsed and the aircraft sustained damage to the nose section, left main landing gear and left hand wing tip tank.The passengers, provincial deputies, were not injured in the accident."
